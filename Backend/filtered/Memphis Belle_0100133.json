The crew shifts uneasily. Dennis stops right in front of Danny and looks at him. Danny thinks he's in big trouble. Then, suddenly, Dennis whoops with joy and pops the cork. Champagne spurts out and Dennis douses the crew with it. The crew is amazed -- this is a new Dennis. They laugh, try to duck the suds, and Bruce takes the picture. FREEZE FRAME. The picture FADES TO black and white as a LEGEND ROLLS OVER it.",
