POWELL’S GARDEN OFFICE - SURREY - NIGHT 8 POWELL withdraws a secure dongle from a pocket in her gow and plugs it into a USB port in a computer on a desk. Jesse knows the routine: he has a basket in here too and lies down in it. The office is full of military books, files, mementoes an photographs: her entire military career is in this room - we immediately understand that this is where she lives ou her life. The house is just where she sleeps. While her computer boots up, POWELL glances at a large pi board on a wall beside her desk: It is covered in hand-written notes and SURVEILLANCE PHOTOGRAPHS taken in various foreign locations of WANTED HVI's - High Value Individuals. The faces are mostly Somali, but we also notice a young British Muslim student named RASHEED HAMUD, and a young American named MUHAMMAD ABDISALAAM. (Note: It does not ma whether we know their nationality at this point, but thei dress is clearly western.) One photograph in particular stands out from the rest: A WHITE WOMAN wearing a deep blue head scarf (a hijab) wh covers her hair. The name SUSAN HELEN DANFORD appears ben the picture, as well as the name “AYESHA AL-HADY.\" Another picture shows Danford without her hijab. She’s an attractive woman in her early thirties. In yet another she is with a man named ABDULLAH AL-HADY - we will learn is her husband. Still other pictures of her show her in various foreign locations. A few copies of different PASSPORTS show her i with different names: ALLISON WEST, REBECCA SUTTON. Below the images of Danford and Al-Hady are dozens of oth YOUNG FACES - some Western dressed, some local Somali fighters with weapons. Some have been inked out in red. POWELL stares at the image of Danford for a moment. Then her computer BLEEPS and she turns to check her in-bo An email message comes up with A PICTURE OF A YOUNG ARMY CORPORAL in a wheelchair wearing PROSTHETIC LEGS. We read \fYELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 5. Dear Colonel Powell The new legs are good. I can walk to the shops, but I don see the point in doing that, or in doing anything. Captain Kirby has suggested... She scrolls to the end: .-. to be honest, I wish I had died. Corporal Shane Allen. Powell sits staring blankly at the picture of the cripple soldier. She is, for a moment, lost. Then she begins to t a reply. Dear Corporal Allen Do not lose hope. Once you recover, I promise to assist i reassigning you... As she types, an INCOMING EMAIL ALERT pops up on her scre Subject: “More news on Ben.” Powell stops writing her reply to the first email. She hesitates, then opens the new one. We READ: This was posted an hour ago. http: //www.al-news.org/watch_now/ Still can't believe we lost him. Good luck this morning. Talk later. Frank POWELL steels herself. Then reluctantly clicks on the lin the email. A NEWS VIDEO CLIP opens. It shows HAND HELD FOOTAGE of A YOUNG, DEAD, AFRICAN MAN plain clothes lying in filth in an alley.

The group claims he was working for British military intelligence attempting to infiltrate their international recruitment networks.

They bitterly resent the role of Britain and the Kenyan military in propping up the UN backed Somali government in Mogadishu. The Ministry of Defense has declined to comment, but denounced the execution as “sickening.” Affected, but stoic, POWELL watches in icy silence. EXT.
