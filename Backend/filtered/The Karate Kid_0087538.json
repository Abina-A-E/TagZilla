Kreese's punch goes up to his elbow through a car windshield Miyagi was standing in front of. Ignoring his bloodied nand, Kreese whiris and throws a skip kick. Again Miyagi sidesteps at the last moment, causing Kreese's kick to connect with the side of his own van. The steel bends beneath his power. Enraged, Kreese lunges at Miyagi to kill him. Miyagi does not move. At the last moment, he raises his hand, palm out, and intercepts Kreese's fist. Kreese stops dead in his tracks. The old man's mouth creases in an ironic smile, as he slowly applies pres- sure to Kreese's fist, forcing Kreese down to his knees. ANGLE ON the Cobra Kai students looking out of the van, their eyes wide witn terror and amazement. ANGLE ON Daniel, proud of his teacher. Kreese is brought to his knees, his eyes for the first time, flicker with fear. Miyagi's smile dies. His eyes turn to stone. He cocks his hand back slowly.",
