The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a musket.",

Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places.  All very well-worn. FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle th chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father. Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefull fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats. Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floo and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh. CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPIN HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood.",

He changes his pace and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and loading while moving.  He never gives the Redcoats a stationary target, especially one marked by billowing smoke from his flintlock.  It's an Indian tactic and it works. The Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS, about to fire... Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD, REVERSES DIRECTION, several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS. Six Redcoats left.  Some primed, some reloading.  A REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground an FIRES, killing him. Samuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket to Nathan who FIRES... The Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY NATHAN'S SMOKE... Marion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS.  He instantly STRIDES OUT INTO THE OPEN, drawing the Redcoats attention from his sons... Marion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS, killing two Redcoats... One Redcoat finishes reloading... Marion rushes him, shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with th butt of the musket... This is a DIFFERENT MARION, a vicious, savage Marion, killing with stunning brutality... Marion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE REDCOAT'S LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shoves that musket into another Redcoat's belly and FIRES... Two Redcoats left, neither finished loading... MARION CHARGES, drawing his TOMAHAWK, ignores a GLANCING BAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open... Splattering himself with BLOOD... The final Redcoat, a cherubic-face young man, ducks into the woods... Marion tears after him... A FOOTRACE... the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THE BRUSH... the older Marion, panting, losing ground... A CLEARING... the Redcoat is almost to the cover of the trees on the far side... MARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air an SINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK... Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT...
