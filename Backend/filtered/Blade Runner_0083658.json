On the metallic surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers fluctuations of the iris. The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits on a table between two men.  The man talking is big, looks like an over-stuffed kid.  \"LEON\" it says on his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool. The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all business, except for the sweat on his face. The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans whir above their heads.",

Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be- hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast. The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma- tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas- senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum plasters her against the door. Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast. Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before she dies. Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it. Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street, trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's running fast, but the car is faster. As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he rolls out FIRING. Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except... The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes through. It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front- ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's laser.  But she doesn't. His last shot burns a hole through the base of her skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed takes what's left of her through the last two windows and into the street where she runs into a parked car with such force that she embeds herself in the side of it.

The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn- ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a dive. Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan. Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.

She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling. Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly swaying. Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure, keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound- ing.  Deckard's in his element. Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face. It's not something he has time to consider.  In the mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open. Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up, crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his neck. Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down. As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris' fingers close around his wrist.

Pris flies off the rings and comes at him. Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al- ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place, she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches out with a long index finger and flips the switch on the machine. It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A bad place for flesh and bone. But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight- year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but it's welded in hers. His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg, wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile driver. Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself. Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine. He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold. It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like it was ice, weight stand in tow. Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets her with a roundhouse in the face. She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and lands in a heap. No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over- head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down for the kill, she freezes. Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it. As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there. He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming her rage.  He FIRES as she comes. The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily in front of her as she charges forward. He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes next to Deckard.  Dead. He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag- gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly. The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It might not sound like a war cry, but it is.",

He kicks the door open and dives through head first and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No response from either door. Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open. Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here. Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut. Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes off her. Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in his lap, closes his eyes and leans back. A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up. A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end. A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting.

The only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING that comes from the bed. Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet. Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down at her. Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of the bed. Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.",

The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth. Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard. Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on knowing.",

She said the great advantage of being alive was to have a choice. And she chose.  And a part of me was almost glad.  Not because she was gone but because this way they could never touch her. As for Tyrell -- he was murdered, but he wasn't dead.  For a long time I wanted to kill him.  But what was the point?  There were too many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael. Maybe real and unreal could never be separated.  The secret never found.  But I got as close with her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd stay with me a long time.  I guess we made each other real.",
