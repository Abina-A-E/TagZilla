Then he looks round, and remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door. There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bisho lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silve is kept.

He looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently aslee He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboa door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean i over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike shou he wake. The Bishop sleeps on.
