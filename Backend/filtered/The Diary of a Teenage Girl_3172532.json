She almost th it on the floor, but then she opens it. ALINE KOMINSKY’S VOICE Dear Minnie. Thank you for your letter. Minnie stirs, realizing it’s from Aline. \f125 103. ALINE KOMINSKY'’S VOICE (CONT’D) It is refreshing to receive a letter from a girl because most letters I get are from greasy fan boys who think that I’m cute. I tend not to write back to them. Keep drawing those comics. Keep drawing anything you can. Just keep drawing. Oh, and I use Indian Ink as well. Love, Aline Kominsky.
