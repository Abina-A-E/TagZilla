Nevertheless, the defense was not able to overcome the power of the video evidence of the defendants taking bribe money.

The scanda was one of the key factors that helped deliver the 1980 Presidential election to Ronald Reagan, which launched a quarter-century long period of Republican rule in America ABSCAM’s impact on organized crime was no less significan in that it helped undermine the Mafia’s master plan to expand and control the gambling industry.
