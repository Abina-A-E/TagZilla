A terrible crunching and ripping noise echoes through the small space. OUR MAN immediately opens his eyes to the so of rushing water. OUR MAN jumps out of the berth and as his feet hit the gr they land in several inches of water inside the cabin of boat. He jumps up. As he looks down several small white knock- Keds kids sneakers are floating in the water. OUR MAN rushes towards the back of the boat, as he enters main cabin he sees a four foot long gash in the side of t boat. There is water pouring into the cabin from the bottom of gash. The gash is located right at the navigation table of the where all the electronics are located. The water is pouri in around and through the electronics including the GPS, RADAR, RADIO, and SATELLITE PHONE. OUR MAN jumps through the rushing water and climbs up the steps to the cockpit of the boat.",

          "text": "Through the early morning light he now sees what has happened. A massive shipping container that had fallen off a cargo is almost completely submerged in the water and is now st to the boat through the gash in the side of the boat. Thousands of the white shoes are floating in the water an emptying from a hole in the container. OUR MAN jumps into action. The boat is heeling (being pushed at an angle due to the pressure on the sails) towards the side of the boat that gash is on allowing the water to flow into the boat. But first he must get the container unhooked from the gas it will sink the boat very soon unless he intervenes. He pushes against it with his feet, kicking. Nothing. Gets o boat hook and tries to use that as a lever. Nothing. Trie kicking and pushing again. Nothing. The water continues to pour into the boat. So he turns and opens a storage locker under the cockpit seats and pulls out a long line (rope). He jumps down onto the half sunk container, lashes a line around one end. Slips several times almost falling into t water. He can now really see that the container is totally lodge place. He jumps back onto the boat and heads down the stairs in the cabin that is now filled with several feet of water. white kids shoes are everywhere. He wades through the water to a front storage locker. He opens it and pulls out a large case that has LIFERAFT wri in red letters on it. But instead of taking the case upst he opens the case and lifts the raft up and grabs a yello looking sack that is stored behind the raft. He heads back up onto the deck. He jumps back down onto the container and takes a metal l that is sticking out of the yellow sack and ties the long rope to it. He now stops and looks around and tries to calmly analyze situation before he takes another move. He looks up at th sails and the wind direction indicator at the top of the mast. He scans the horizon. Finally he shakes the contents out of the yellow bag, it fills with air. It is a small parachute of some kind. (It a SEA ANCHOR, a device that is used in extreme weather, t help stabilize a boat by dragging it under the water. The parachute holds the boat back as huge waves thrash it) He shakes out the sea anchor and holds it over the edge of storage container into the water. The water catches in the chute and starts pulling the rop that is spooled on the deck. The rope unspools, as he jum back onto the boat and gets behind the steering wheel wai for the rope to run out. The coil of rope gets shorter and shorter and finally it all gone. In one extremely loud and jarring move the container rips of the hull of the boat as OUR MAN turns the wheel of the boat away from the container. He is free. He immediately turns the boat onto the other tack (the opposite point of sail) so that the boat is now leaning t other direction so that the gash is up in the air slightl that water is no longer coming in through the hole. He immediately looks back at the container that he is lea in the distance and seems to be making a decision. He turns around, scans the horizon. Looks down into the that is filled with water, then reaches out to the lines controlling the sails and begins to turn the boat around towards the container... what is he doing? He sails the boat back towards the container but at this point of sail he is not always able to heel the boat enou to keep the water from coming in, so the water continues pour in every so often. He finally approaches the shipping container again. It si in the water looking like every inch the destructive forc that it has been. He looks back up at the wind indicator again trying to ga an approach strategy. He turns the boat abruptly into the wind and comes up nex the side of the submerged container. He stalls out his boat, the water starts coming into the again as the boat levels, he jumps back onto the containe",
