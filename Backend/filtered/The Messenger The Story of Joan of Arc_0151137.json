A SWORD.  The background SOUND of the bells grows ominous.  A shooting star silently flashes across the sky -- then scores of them.  She gets to her feet and picks up the heavy sword.  It's growing darker -- colder -- the leaves have turned to autumn brown, now blown abou by a gust of wind. Presently she sees a WOLF approaching, slowly but straigh toward her -- then two, three -- finally the whole pack. She grips the sword, but can't use it -- too heavy, too frightened.
