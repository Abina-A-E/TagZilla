And the left to right move is the first move the CAMERA makes, PANNING across the dying men, some of them with their guns still in their holsters and then as the gunfire ends, another sound begins, just as loud and just as terrifying and this sound is a screan It doesn't come from any one bandit, it isn't even con- nected in any actual way with any one man, but it is the loudest scream anyone ever heard and it peaks almost im- mediately and then it really starts to build as the blood starts pouring from the Bandits, from their chests, mouth eyes. And once the left to right move is over, TEE CAMERA BEGINS ITS SECOND MOVE, and the direction of the second move is down, as gradually, the Bandits, no longer able . to stand, start slipping gracelessly to earth. Md every second the action freezes them in their final trip, and the scream keeps them company, and even though the trip is short, it still takes time for all six to Slip and stagger and crumble awkwardly to their kmees and beyond, toppling sideways and backwards end forwards, but always down, colliding finally with the hard earth which is red now with their blood as it leaves their dying bodies and as the scream ends, the blood continues to drain cease- lessly into the ground... : cuT TO:",
