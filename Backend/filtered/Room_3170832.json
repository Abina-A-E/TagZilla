A sink, with a single worn toothbrush, toothpaste, dish s a broken comb, folded rags for washcloths. A small square mirror tile hung up over it. A small kitchen cabinet. A dish rack: two each of big and small white plates, bowls, tumblers, knives, forks, spoon (one with a melted handle), a scissors, can opener, serra knife, wooden spoon, spatula.
