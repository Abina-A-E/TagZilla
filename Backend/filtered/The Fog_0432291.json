MALONE LUNGES FOR THEM as the lids POP OPEN, sending hund of gold coins to the bottom of the sea, when The hung rope FREES ITSELF. The life boat falls, smacking down into the water. Relieved, MALONE turns his back on t smoldering ship, picking gold coins off the floor of the lifeboat, when A HAND SMASHES THROUGH ONE OF THE PORTHOLES, burnt flesh dripping from the bone, locking MALONE in a death grip! Out of his wits, MALONE struggles to break free, HACKING the hideous hand, bashing at it with an oar as the SCREAM from inside the DANE build into an unholy frenzy. With a last, bone-crunching WHACK, the hand withers and MALONE is free. He rows away from the doomed ship using a his strength, gliding past. a barnacle-encrusted BUOY... And WE HOLD ON THE BUOY, bobbing in the ocean, as a hund years of time and tide pass before our eyes... A SLEEK WHITE CHARTER BOAT powers past the BUOY, splashin with a glassy sheet of water. NICK CASTLE, 20, is on the FLYBRIDGE, at the helm of this foot luxo SPORT-FISHING BOAT. His hair is blown back by t wind, emphasizing his raw good looks. His SWEATSHIRT tell us who he’s working for: ANTONIO BAY SPORT-FISHING CHARTE WORKING THE REAR OF THE BOAT is BRETT SPOONER, 20, Nick's best friend and fellow employee. Simple, honest, made of good stuff, SPOONER’S got a mop of surfer’s hair, and has yet lost all his baby fat... SPOONER uses a mean-looking BONING KNIFE to splay open a yellowfin, while TWO SUNBURNED FISHERMEN drink beer after day on the water. SPOONER offers up a slice of raw tuna.",
