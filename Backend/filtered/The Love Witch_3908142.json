TINY FEET step around THE CLOAK and kick square-toed shoes. Jagged, fungal toe-nails poke out of soiled wool stockings. THE OLD HANDS grab the BABY’S COLLAR, tear open his linen shift, and strip it off the child. SAMUEL starts to cry. THE FIGURE steps away from the table, her back to camera. Hobbling in and out of blackness of the hovel, she takes her bonnet and scanty grey locks fall to her shoulders, snaking across her bent spine. She removes the rest of he filthy clothes, and for an instant, HER NAKED BODY is revealed... before she moves back into shadow. HER HANDS reach up to the low THATCH CEILING, over THE BA and tear out a mossy clump. Little bits of dirt and reed, other natural scantlings fall on SAMUEL. BRIGHT MOONLIGHT shines through the hole, bathing the child in its light. OFF SCREEN, THE OLD WOMAN hums a haunting song. Her HANDS stroke the baby tenderly and pinches the fatty areas arou his thighs and biceps. Her HAND take a LARGE RUSTY KNIFE... she holds it up over child's breast... she continues to hum her song... CAMERA ON: The humpback and scabby head of THE OLD WOMAN. She brings the knife up... and then down in a swift motio (WE DO NOT SEE THE BABY, only the back of THE OLD WOMAN) \f10. AUDIO: CHOP!

All appear misshapen and distorted by the night. All of them filthy and nude or in strange patches and shreds of cloth They hold broomsticks, poles, distaffs and pitchforks. THE WITCHES DANCE, gyrating, shaking, and quivering in a trance-like reverie around a cauldron and fire in front o THE WITCH'S HOVEL. Depraved. Subhuman. Bestial.

SHE JOINS CIRCLE, laughing a little too, blushing... then laughs mo and more, WITH EVERY GROWING MOMENT HER SORROWS MELT AWAY",
