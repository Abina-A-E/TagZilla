Hundreds of bubbles rise past as the camera swims lazily through azure seas sparkling with sunlight and teeming with brightly colored tropical fish. The bubbles swirl past as we dive down, the water turning paler, the fish becoming duller and more scarce. A large shark swims past us, on the prowl. Deeper and deeper we dive. Soon the water is black as night. Only the faintest slivers of light penetrate down here, and then quickly flicker and die. Large shadowy creatures of the ultra-deep haunt the edges of our vision. Strange luminescent fish with long pointy teeth dart past. The sea bottom draws near, a flat plain scarred by an enormous impact crater, miles in diameter. WE glide over the outer wall, the crater floor looms beneath us. On the bottom, a faint light glimmers. It is an undersea station, a series of five cylinders linked by a central hub. It looks like a giant starfish resting quietly on the ocean floor. Several hundred yards beyond the station, the faint lights of the bio-lab can be seen.
