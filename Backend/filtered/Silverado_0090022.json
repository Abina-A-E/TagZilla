Now, a pair of boots stan empty by the rotting remains of a rough-hewn bunk, up to holstered gun hung on the corner of the bed. The still sh of a man, a bedroll his only protection from the splinter planks. This is EMMETT, fast asleep. The door of the shack bursts inward as a Gunman crashes i For a moment he is silhouetted against the blinding morni light, his two six-guns blasting even before the door has bounced shut behind him, returning the hut to darkness. Emmett's holster, the gun gone. The gun is here in Emmett's hand, erupting now with three quick explosions. The intruder flies against the far wall the hut and lands on the floor dead. From outside, two bu pierce the plank wall behind Emmett, light streaming thro in .45 calibre shafts. Emmett is out of the bunk and on the floor. He fires once over the bunk. In the moment of quiet that follows, we he running FOOTSTEPS outside the hut. Emmett follows their  progress with the point of his gun, but holds his fire.  Suddenly a shotgun blasts a large hole in the roof of the shack, and the table disintegrates in a new column of lig Emmett glances upward, but quickly returns his attention the side walls, trying to follow that gunman. Now more fi comes from there and more footsteps. Another shotgun blas showers Emmett with debris, but he ignores it, concentrat on the walls. WHAT HE SEES. The Man Outside moves quickly past a crack the wall, momentarily revealing his spot by blocking the  light. Emmett fires once ahead of him, stopping his progr and forcing him back to the crack. Emmett fires his last  shot there, and the man outside goes down hard. The shotgun rips another jagged hole in the ceiling and b a crater in the dirt by Emmett's foot. The shape of a man flashes across the new hole. Emmett looks across the room the top bunk, where the barrel of his Winchester protrude few inches from the bare planks. Emmett throws his empty gun noisily into the far corner of the hut. Instantly the man on the roof blasts away in that direction. Emmett dives for the bunk. With the tips of his fingers, pulls hard on the muzzle. The Winchester flips full circl into the air as the bunk behind it is shredded from above With an odd kind of inevitability, as though seeking its  rightful place, the Winchester arcs into a shaft of light where it is met by Emmett's steady, waiting hands. Before has even settled, he has cocked and fired twice through a hole in the roof. Emmett stops and lowers the carbine. Th Man on the Roof falls spread-eagled through the weakened  ceiling. Debris and sunlight shower his lifeless form. Emmett listens, moves silently to the door, and opens it  carefully. WE FOLLOW him outside, out into the bright  sunlight, into the awesome promise of the American West.",

Out of the night, streaming around the farm  buildings, comes a horde of masked Cowboys, McKendrick's  men. They send up a horrible yell and begin firing their  weapons in the air. Their arrival is so sudden that the celebrants are frozen their places, mothers hugging children to them, men far f their weapons. There are SCREAMS. Emmett grabs a panicked child from the path of the horses and moves back, passing her to Hannah. He's trying to gau his response in the midst of all these innocents. Two Cowboys have roped opposite ends of a section of fenc and now pull the deadly drag, already thick with ravaged  corn, through the barnyard, knocking over everything in i path. Jake slides through the chaos toward his gunbelt, hung on peg on the barn wall. A Cowboy pulls the gate from the pigsty, and the pigs squ out. Another Cowboy begins shooting them with a Henry rif On the roof, Carol looks in horror at the death of her pr sow. Emmett is herding as many Settlers as he can toward the c of the barn.

Two Cowboys with prepared torches in their hands rid up to the bonfire and swing low, lighting their firebrand One moves ahead toward the farmhouse, reins his horse, an heaves the torch high in the air toward the roof on which the two children perch. In the air, the tumbling flame suddenly explodes at the R of a shotgun. Sparks shower harmlessly to the ground. Bradley has shot it out of the air with one barrel of his shotgun. The blast has created a momentary, shocked lull the attack. Bradley looks wild. Emmett watches, fearful. His hand is on his gun. Hoyt looks at Bradley. Bradley swings the shotgun around  toward the other torch-bearer. The Cowboy who tossed the first torch shoots Bradley dead Carol screams. Emmett looks across the yard at Jake, who steps out from cowering homesteaders, a gun in each hand. Emmett draws a kills the man who shot Bradley. Now all the Settlers hit dirt. Jake fires from both hands repeatedly. One Cowboy dies an another takes it in the arm. The man who was shooting the pigs swings his rifle around toward Jake, and Emmett kill him with one shot. Hoyt reacts big to the presence of deadly wolves in the m of these sheep. He peers through the tumult, trying to se their faces. His Cowboys are shooting wildly into the cro now, but he rides through them, signalling a retreat. Emmett jumps from the top of a fence to the roof of the h the Henry rifle in his hand. He scrambles to the peak of roof, where the two children still cower. Bracing the rif on the chimney, he takes careful aim. Once... twice... he fires. One Cowboy dead, one wounded and fleeing.

One of the  boys took to feeding it, so it  followed us everywhere. Anyway, this  one time we were leaving a little  Missouri town in quite a hurry, with  a bunch of the locals on our tails.  The dog somehow got tangled up with  Tyree's horse and Tyree went flying.  Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped  up, so he shot the dog. Didn't kill  him, though. Before you know it,  Paden's off his horse and holding  the dog. He'd gone all strange on  us. Said we should go on without  him. I thought he was kidding at  first. But he wasn't. Tyree was ready  to plug 'em both. And all this with  the posse coming down on us. Here I  thought we were pals after all that  riding. And suddenly he's more worried  about a mutt.
