Not only is chaos in the streets of the city as Satan and his minions establish a foothold, but buildings collapse, others are from the underground and éfire and brimstonei makes its p known---on a very large scale. The heart and soul, so to of the drama lies in the characters of the heroic securit who becomes the iProtectori of the woman chosen by Satan wife.
