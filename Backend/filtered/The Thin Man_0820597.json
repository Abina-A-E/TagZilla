He has a fine, sensi- tive face.  He is a very successful inventor.   A man who is capable of sudden fits of anger  which he forgets almost immediately, but which  are quite terrifying while they last.  Just now  he is utterly absorbed in what he is doing --  working on a delicately-wired part which has to  do with a new form of combustion engine that he  has invented.  (Through the entire scene, from  the first shadow effect, we hear the engine in  operation as he is working over it.)  Wynant is  dressed in overalls, and possibly a long shade  over his eyes.  The shop itself is in the base- ment of a small warehouse building, in the thir- ties between First Avenue and the East River,  in New York.  It is a long and narrow machine  shop, full of interest and character in its  mechanical layout.  Miniatures of engine-models  of various kinds -- vats of molten lead -- car- bon racks -- welding instruments -- delicate  light bulbs, and such other apparatus as com- poses a combination shop and laboratory of this  machine type.
