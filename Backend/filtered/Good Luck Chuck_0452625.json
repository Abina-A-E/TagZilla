Cam looks down to see Charlie on the conveyer belt. He smiles up at her. She falters momentarily, but continues. CAM (cont‘d) The female lays a single egg, then rolls it onto the feet of the male. The male stands and incubates the egg until it hatches -- about 65 days. Having built up a thick layer of fat to sustain him through the long winter, he never leaves the egg to hunt for food. The female, who spends the entire incubation period foraging in the ocean, returns before the chick hatches.
