He shrugs his shoulders and pours out a large amount and pours in more vodka. He drinks it and nods his head. He stares at the cup and then the bottle and shrugs again and pours out all the contents of the cup and fills all with the vodka and begins to chug the contents. He finishes it and replenishes the cup and repeats the chug. Cut to the little kid from across the street staring at a passed out MIKE on the lawn wearing nothing but a pair of tightie whitey’s. The kid nudges MIKE with his foot a few times and MIKE weakly pushes his foot away and rolls over into a fetal position.

He then tucks the letter in pocket and takes a seat at the bar next to the Old Man fr the previous scene in which MIKE almost got into a fight with him. MIKE puts his arm around the guy and gives the signal for two beers. The camera then goes in reverse, pulling out on the same route it did as on the way in, passing all the same people again, the blind date is bore as Rick is droning on and flexing his bicep, KYLE and his girlfriend are playing kissey face, MARK is still yelling JOSH and shoving a spray paint can in his face and STEVE still flirting with the same girl. The door closes and th scene fades into INT. - MAGGIE’S CAR - DRIVES AWAY - DUSK MAGGIE driving with her car full of boxes. She has been crying recently and/or still is. The camera moves to look her hands and she is holding/rubbing the watch MIKE has b wearing the whole time. She looks at it and wipes her eye \f97. she kisses it and a small smile creeps into her face. The scene fades to black.",
