Traffic snarls as CLEET COMMANDOS slide down. Four of them.  Plainclothed with discreet com-headsets. Wearing jackets, we catch glimpses of the equipment slung on their hips, including machine pistols.  Each has a 2X3 piece of paper taped to his wrist.  Like NFL quarterbacks with the plays, except the papers are photos of Jerry. The helicopter is gone so fast some people haven't even noticed.  The commandos disperse into the crowd, refer to their wrists as they advance in Jerry's direction. Jerry hightails it the opposite way, tries not to attract attention.  He pulls up in front of a movie theater as a second chopper swoops in to drop four more commandos at the south intersection.  The street has been sealed off. Jerry stands there a beat, not sure what to do. Something makes him look across the street where CLEET #1 pulls up, looks over at him.
