ED takes a closer look, Now he can make out the stacked coffins, and the MEN moving among them. Some kind of mechanical digger is at work. The CHILDREN scamper off downstream leaving ED a very solitary figure. He looks down intently at the river, perhaps to fix it in his mind or maybe he expscts it to yield up soma secrat, an answer, He looks back at the graveyard, frowning. TWO MEN hump a coffin on their shoulders. Suddenly, tne rote ting side of the coffin falls away, They stop and try and get a better hold, but the bottom sags and then collapses and their whole burden disintegrates. They walk off une concernedly and pick up another coffin which the mechani- cal. digger has gouged out of the ground. - ; ED watches this scene with a puzzled look as though it recalls a memory, or is the echo of 4 forgotten dream, During this the first line of Duelling Benjoes is heard, repeated over and over at first faintly, then more strong ly, the banjo answering the guitar. .",
