For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, ginge steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the grinding noise. She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to t next. The roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree, her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squin down toward the cabin's back lot. A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilt jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over large power tool which his body blocks from view. Marge advances. The man is forcing downward something which engages the roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises. The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath ste as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing dow shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn. The roar is very loud. Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking. Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which w can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom. Marge's eyes shift. A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud. Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log. He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine. Marge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward Grimsrud, who is still turned away. Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand. Marge closes in, grimacing. Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the lo that pushes down into the machine. The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest o Carl Showalter's body. Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.
