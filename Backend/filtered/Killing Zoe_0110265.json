Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of t cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monot loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not  permissible and that should any bags be left unattended t they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from oth automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song \"Batonga\". Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CL UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside. He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.",
