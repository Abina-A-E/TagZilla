Through the flames and against them we see the thrashing movements of a NAKED FEMALE FIGURE, mid 20's, which gyrat writhes and flexes. Her eyes roll in a strange, deadened ecstasy as she dance some unheard music and the tongue protrudes tasting the smoking air. The scene is elemental, rapturous, primitive. The smoke pours off the blaze as her body shakes like a rattlesnakes tail. She shows no pain or pleasure as she cavorts, and flings sweat and stomps in abandonment with arms outstretched.

It convulses, then folds in on itself, as if suppressing instinct to surge. Then a flux, and intricate structures begin to grow from black mass, conjured like some abominable spell. Something is articulating itself into form. A surface bulge develops a protrusion and from it emerges long weaving BLACK LIMB. Like a living tentacle. The limb unfurls with an unpleasant manner, snaking forwa with a meandering reach. It is soon free from the body of the black mass and movin across a white, flaring surface. We feel other movement within it as it slips toward us. Here and there, a sudden gleam reveals a spike. They thicken and waver, then become solid with intent. Plumes of spikes flourish, then fold into a triangular fo shocking in its geometric perfection. \fThen a slither of flat, rectangular black. Then a cube. Then an octahedron. The sides multiply exponentially until it becomes a spher It's as if it's expressing that it can become anything. It hovers in an expanse of white, flaring, beautiful ligh Now a colorless circle, like the skin of a drum, appears aligns with the black sphere. It folds itself over, covering it. We recognize its detail as the parts of a human eye. We see the pupil that sits within the iris is not a black lens as we expect, but a perfect cylindrical cavity reach back through the sphere. Now a black tendril aligns itself with the cavity. It slides through the back to the other end through the s where the pupil should be. The form that was a sphere is now an EYE, indecipherable the real thing. A TONGUE is in the space, flanked by TWO EYES just above. The formation drifts into position alongside a motionless human, FEMALE FACE, like humming birds hovering at a flow The MOUTH and EYE SOCKETS open perversely wide. The tongue enters. And docks. The cavernous mouth closes. The spheres enter their two cavities as if drawn on threa The eyelids close. The lids open again. EYES shimmer in the gloom, brand new and clear. We close into the bright twin forms until rays pour in an the eyehole shapes fill with light. The two ellipses blend into one viewpoint. \f4. And through them, through ‘her' eyes, we see the perfect sphere of EARTH as seen from space. A black HAND-SHAPE slips inside the flaccid synthetic glo of a HUMAN HAND. The fingers stiffen then splay, the internal hand stretch into command of the puppet around it. The fingers wriggle provocatively then clench into a fist A photorealistic masquerade of bone, knuckle, vein and musculature hardening into this little boulder of attitud Now we cut to her actual POV. The camera as an eye. Which looks down at the two hands in front of us. We lift them closer to study them. The fist points towards us, knuckle on, full of portent. Then it is lowered. Beyond them, still looking down, we see our feet standing this flaring white light which is everywhere. Then they begin to walk and of course we walk with them, the time looking down on them as if they were our own. Left foot then right then left and so on. We look over the top of our breasts and dip further over as if we could crane our neck at an impossible angle to s our navel and our pubis. Then, still looking down at our own walking body our viewpoint arcs to the left so we are now looking down at top of our own shoulder. Then our viewpoint rotates across the shoulder so we are looking at our back and the top of our buttocks and again crane further out to watch the backs of our calves as thi craft, this body, continues its slow walk forwards. It's as though we've rotated our whole head 180 degrees t view this impossible angle of ourself. Then our body stops, and as it does so, our viewpoint com back round over our shoulder, still looking down, and bac round to the front. Now our viewpoint lifts and we cut to an image of the who of her. A serene, assured YOUNG WOMAN - black hair, beautiful ski All is wonderfully charged yet also dormant. \fA picture of indomitable femininity. We are studying the anatomy in some detail. Shoulder, knee, abdomen, nipple. But non-sexually. Non fetishistic. Factual. Anatomical. Like a technician might inspect a car fresh off a product line.",

A thin, rectangular LINE OF PURE WHITE LIGHT about two mi long is held in perfect parallel with the horizon. It sits motionless a hundred and fifty feet above the surface, and three miles off shore. It is beautiful - as harmonious as it is worrying. Comple omnipotence. The sea beneath it is millpond calm. A gentle tide sweepi into the shore is all that can be heard. Far out, something is moving slowly towards us. A refract imperfection of the light on the water's surface. It is an object moving on the water towards us. As we watch its approach, we eventually see what it is. A BOAT. A fifteen-foot long, black, wooden skiff gliding towards Seemingly under its own steam as if a giant finger had propelled it. Soon it is in the shallows and the hull glides into a gri against the pebbles. From behind camera, the Bad Man enters frame. What tells us he’s not human is that he's not looking at thing in the sky. His attention is totally on the boat instead. As he reaches the bow, he drags it up onto the stones. The Bad Man now throws back a cover to reveal the Young Woman, vacuum-packed in transparent material. The Bad Man steadies the boat in the swell. He takes out knife, makes a few deft cuts in the packaging. There is no sudden gasping for air or dramatic coming to life. The naked female simply steps out of its plastic sheathing, and then from the boat onto the shore. The Bad Man throws a blanket round her. She waits there silently in the half-light with a look of abstraction. The Bad Man pushes the boat adrift again. The two figures turn and walk shoulder to shoulder up the beach. It's here, as we pan away from the sea to follow their wa that we see where we are. \f10 The wild landscape of Northern Scotland. Not a word has been spoken, not a gesture imparted.

The footprints weave off along the dunes eager to find a far away from all the others. She is drawn with them. Far off she can see the main beac and its holiday-makers. 'There', are families and a stretch of sand, laughter and dogs barking. 'Here', is rocky and quiet. Her eyes scan about and find those significant footprints emerge by the shoreline. A LONE MAN in cut-off jeans walks in the breakers. Off to the west, a YOUNG COUPLE sit on a rock. They watch their YOUNG CHILD splash in a shallow pool, th dog leaps in the surf. The low sun sparkles off the water around them. The couple lean closer and become one shape against the ocean. The space between them flashes like a message. Kiss - Sparkle - Kiss Laura focuses on the lone man again. He is pulling his shirt off. He's about thirty, toned. He runs towards the sea. In he goes like a dart. Laura looks at the muscular swimmer as she walks to the beach. The sun plays around her perfect flesh and hair. \f27. He swims through the glitter like he's on rails. Laura sits on the sand near his rucksack and boots. He comes back into the shallows. Distant laughter beckons attention along the beach towards the family. Laura follows his gaze. The toddler splashes the dog as it bounds between his roc pool and the tide. The father watches as the dog thrashes into the foam. Giggles and yelps mingle with the waves. The young mother walks into the breakers. She laughs as t undertow shifts her gently. Now the swimmer is walking back towards his things. As he approaches, Laura smiles. He almost stops dead in his tracks but makes it to the rucksack. He pulls out a towel and rolls it around on his head.",

The shout again from the woman to the animal but the drif the stick is enticing it farther out. The swimmer moves away from Laura and back towards the wa edge. Now the dog is in the heavy water. The father calls out t it. The child is still splashing in his rock pool. The mother decides to swim out. It doesn't seem that far the animal. She strokes out, then looks up. She is feeling the deep tug of the powerful undertow and becoming unnerved. The husband edges deeper into the breakers expecting his to turn back. She sets to again but her stroke is erratic. The dog is gone from his thoughts now although yelps sign it's in serious trouble. \f29. Sweat breaks on the husband and his eyes fill with alarm his wife goes under for the first time. He plunges in. The mother's face is frozen in realization as the waves s to push at her from all sides. Her open mouth gasps for oxygen and help. No sound. Gulls scream above. The swimmer is now running away from Laura and down the beach. The husband ploughs through the water towards his wife. In another dozen strokes he'll be in with her and in the of the rip tide too. The swimmer is running hard and hits the water like a torpedo. He is moving rapidly towards them. The tide draws her harder and the distance between her an her husband opens up. She goes down for the second time. The husband is pushing after her, his fear drawing his en at every stroke. The wife flails then goes under. Gone. The husband gasps with dread, and feeling the tide pullin around him tries to hasten his stroke. Suddenly the swimmer is at his shoulder. The husband kicks away from him, but his energy is almost spent. The swimmer tries to wrestle for control. Him against the pull, the husband writhing to free himself. The swimmer forces the fight out of him with a clench the flips back, dragging the husband against the current. The swimmer throws exhausted strokes, digging clear of th turbulent water. Stroke clear, kick clear, clear. As his feet touch down, the swimmer drags the man away fr the draw of the tide. \f29 30. He battles hard for every step until his legs start to bu with fatigue. With the last of his strength he pushes the man out then collapses into the sand, chest heaving, eyes swimming wit fainting delirium. The exhausted husband stands... and walks back out to sea The swimmer tries to raise himself. Tries to follow. But spent.

He moves inside and out expertly. Bit by bit it rolls away, creating a tiny bundle that fit under his arm. He stands and looks at the spot. All that is left is a flattened rectangle in the sand. The winds are already blurring the edges of the shape int obscurity. His task complete, he turns back towards the ridge of the dune and the car park it leads to. Thirty feet along the ridge, the Bad Man sees the boy has made his way to the path. The child is standing there in silent desperation, devour by fear. He shivers a little under the Bad Man’s gaze and his eyes roam about as he ponders what crying out actually achieve a situation like this. The Bad Man looks at the child without so much as a blink is covered with a dusting of sand especially around his n and mouth where his tears and slobbers have become caked grit.

There is no meaning in his gaze, he is simply measuring equations, examining the possibilities for the most exped action. Satisfied, or rather having understood the probabilities fully, he simply turns away. After a dozen steps, the toddler realizes the Bad Man’s leaving. At first it is like a groan or a deep hum but as the dist between them opens, the power of the sound increases in a astounding way. He now experiences a squeal that reverberates on a cosmic level, a noise of such pitch as to stop the gulls in the to silence the waves. He hears it all the way to the motorbike and even as he k starts the engine the sound still cuts through. Does he drive away in haste? It's hard to say. Perhaps it just us wishing him to flee.

We drift down until we are close to her. Her eyes are shut now, in a way we have never seen them s before. Her face is still, in true repose. She is fast asleep. Or switched off. It's impossible to k which. Five or six little ANTS are moving on her face. The busy creatures hurry in their searching rhythms over cheeks and across her forehead and neck. She doesn’t stir. The water laps on the shore, the wind eases through the h leaves. Tranquillity rules. Then her expression begins to change. She appears troubled. Like she's wrestling with thoughts, maybe a bad dream? Now she's trying to rouse herself, to force her eyes open Then she wakes, and in a feverish split second looks abou herself confusedly. She looks down at the hem of her dress, and sees a dirty, green, male forearm extending in. She starts bolt upright. The arm remains. She stares at the owner of the arm. It is A MAN in a green boiler suit looking at her impassi and possessed. She kicks out wildly, jolts to her feet, turns and flees. She moves as fast as she can on the soft sands of the loc \f84. Suddenly a trudging sound accelerates behind her but she off the sandy ground now. Her feet carrying her more swif into cover. Now abruptly she wheels round expecting the thing claspin her to be this man but she is snagged on a thorn bush. As she fumbles to free herself, she hears the muddied footfalls of the man advancing through bracken in pursuit She gets more entangled. It's as if the thorn bush were pecking at her. She twists to get free then ducks down into cover. She is still. Off in the undergrowth, more uncertain sounds. Then a precise stepping sound nearby. The crushing of twig, the swish of briars pushed aside. He is close now. She stares through the dense bushes. A broken form amidst the camouflage of a million leaves. The shape of him gathers and is almost complete, then vanishes. Footsteps off to the left. Suddenly the leaves there shudder. A thrash of a heavy body pushes through, footsteps quickening. Laura edges out from her hiding place onto open ground. S starts running again out onto a path. Suddenly up ahead at the turn in the lane - a shape. A truck! Someone is working here! She makes a b-line for it, deciphering the logging truck' long angular crane and claw full of logs swaying in the a above it. This is her lifeline - she charges towards it. She arrives and goes towards the cab door, trying the han It opens. She steps up onto its running board and looks in. No keys \f85. She clambers up into the interior scrabbling for keys, fo phone, for something. Nothing, nothing. Panic takes her. She leans on the horn, looking off into the woods for the workmen who operate the huge claw and who must be nearby. The horn drones with urgency, she puts all her weight on She knows the sound will bring salvation and drive the be away. Her eyes scan the woods on either side longing for signs life - a sudden friendly face to appear in alarm but inst up ahead a figure slowly steps out onto the road. Suddenly she crouches down behind the wheel. The figure is walking down the lane towards here without haste, like someone who has nothing particular to do. It's him. And of course this is his truck. He's the Woodsman. She throws herself from the cab and runs. Behind her, hea footsteps pound just out of sight. Then, just over her shoulder, two arms flail through bran just a few feet away. She leans into her run searching fo space to burst into. The forest re-absorbs them. But then the big grabbing han looms into view again. Suddenly there it is on her shoulder. He throws her to th ground. They tumble through mud. She tries to get away but he pul her back. Gets on top of her, pins her down. Above her on all fours, he tears at her dress and bra. A flurry of grabbing. He reaches down into his pants. She lashes into his eye. He returns with a vicious swipe. Hard sweeping movement f his elbows contain her struggling.

Tight on the Woodsman's wide, horrified eye. The alien is reflected in his lens. He turns and runs. Laura hobbles off gathering herself to herself. She reels from the effort of moving this disconnected bod which slips from her with every step. She rests on a fallen tree, looking at her human skin. She is holding her torn neck and much of her face between hands. The beautiful, gentle face looks up at the black alien he looking down. Hunched over her “self”, in an extraordinary separation. \f80 87. The inside looking at the outside, the outside looking at inside. Bewildered footsteps, and the Woodsman staggers back into scene. In one hand he shakily points his phone at her - videoing her! In the other, a jerry can. She tries to gather her exhausted selves together, sudden realizing his intent. She juggles the elements of the once perfect body as best can, and tries to flee, but it's too late. He puts his phone in his pocket and with both hands clatt a tin above her head and pours as she staggers, trying to move away from the petrol flowing over her. He wrestles his lighter to strike.
