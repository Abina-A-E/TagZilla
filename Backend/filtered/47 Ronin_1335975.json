A rather than a steel sword, he practices with a bokken -- wooden blade -- and thin air as his target. But despite his lower status -- perhaps even because of i Minoru has dedicated himself more seriously to the sword any around him.

But that’s where the forward momentum stops and the war o strength begins. OUTSIDE, more men pile on the doors, try to force them shut, while INSIDE Basho strains mightily against their combined efforts. KIRA’S SOLDIERS AND WARRIOR MONKS lash out at anyone within reach -- men, women, children - but find their weapons BLOCKED by ronin swords that appea from nowhere, protecting the innocents then striking thei own lethal return blow. An arrow about to take a child’s life is SEVERED IN MID-A by Minoru’s saving sword -- and before the cleaved arrow fall to the ground, Minoru snatches it out of the sky and stabs it into the face of an attacking warrior monk. OISHI defends against three warrior monks, SHATTERING all three of their weapons with a single angry strike. But as much damage as they’re doing, the ronin are desperately outnumbered and are starting to take heavy casualties. \f93. ISOGAI and others take a hail of musket balls through the shoulders, legs, arms. HANJO barely slips aside from an iron fan slice chop mean brain him and loses his left ear for the effort. MINORU ducks away from a decapitating swipe of a RAZOR-SH WHIP CHAIN and we PUSH INTO A SLOW-MO ECU as the tip of t enemy’s steel whip NICKS HIS NECK, drawing only a single of blood. And though he fells one opponent after another, OISHI’s b is RAKED OPEN by dual tiger hooks. They have to get out.",
