LANDING AREA OUTSIDE 4077TH MASH – DAY Our attention is concentrated on a sign reading: \"THIS IS WHERE IT IS – PARALLEL 38.\" Below these words, arrows poi to \"NORTH KOREA\" in one direction, \"SOUTH KOREA\" in oppos one. Two Air Rescue helicopters are coming in low from th north, descending to a point just outside the entrance to the hospital Admitting Ward. Transferring our attention to the helicopters, our gaze g from the first sign to a second one, on which all we can  read at first are the very large letters: \"M-A-S-H.\" Movi closer to the helicopters as they hit the ground, we can  make out the rest of the sign. Above the four large lette it says: \"4077TH,\" and then we see there is the remainder a word following each of the large letters, but in much  smaller print, so that \"M-A-S-H\" becomes \"Mobile Army Sur Hospital.\" The helicopters land and enlisted men of the U Army Medical Corps Carry two wounded soldiers from each i the Admitting Ward. LIEUTENANT COLONEL HENRY BLAKE, a permanent member of the Medical Corps and Commanding Officer of the 4077th, watch grimly as the wounded are borne from the helicopters into his hospital.

Trapper is operating,  assisted by another surgeon, a couple of nurses, a corpsm and the anesthesiologist, UGLY JOHN BLACK. Beside these a participants almost all the nurses and doctors from both  shifts, including Duke, Hawkeye (with Lieutenant Dish), F and Henry, are in a circle around the operating table as  spectators. Trapper's job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart a involving a large chest incision. We see enough of the pr to observe that it is gory and deep inside a critical are but necessarily it is the reactions of the people watchin especially Duke and Hawkeye, that tell us how tricky an  operation it is and how expertly Trapper is handling it. The sequence is silent except for incidental operating ro noises. Even Trapper's occasional terse instructions to his assis and his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low us to hear. There are four stages to the action: 1. The beginning of the operation before an attentive  audience, drawn by their interest in the new man and by t fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never da to attempt. 2. Limited approval and professional respect for the assu with which Trapper plots his incision and starts working way to his destination. 3. Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached. The  suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when Tr is doing the actual mending job to which all the prelimin have led. The faces of his colleagues express anxiety and hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and  accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to sur Henry, not certain of his own judgment, looks to Duke for confirmation, and Duke nods to indicate he thinks Trapper has the situation under control. 4. The tension breaks as Trapper finishes the job to his  satisfaction and begins, along with his assistant surgeon to close up. Henry's smile of relief is unsure and only  tentative until he catches Hawkeye's signal that the job been done to perfection.",
