His hair is long and unshorn and he wears a costume woven from ivy leaves, skins and vines.  On his feet are bark sandals.  His features are tanned berry-brown and woven into his tangled locks is a wreath of flowers.  He is a legendary \"Green Man\" or \"Wild Man\" who lives the free life of a hermit alone in the deep woods. Jack, the \"Green Man,\" feeds morsels of bread and fruit t the animals dancing around his feet.  He is a friend to all the beasts of the forest and carries food for them in a split-willow basket.  Birds fly down and land on his head and shoulders, taking seeds and nuts from his lips. The musical sound of someone approaching alerts him.  His eyes have an animal quickness and his instincts are as finely tuned as any creature of the wild.  The birds fly from his shoulders to the treetops.  His furred companion dart for cover.  In three quick bounds, Jack is himself u a nearby tree, clinging to a high branch like a cat. The Princess Lili comes singing down the path.

Jack pushes through the underbrush and is lost from sight For a moment, the princess is confused and nervous at being left alone in such circumstances, but she peers out at the unicorns and the sight of such beauty rekindles he resolve.

The unicorns lift their heads from the stream and watch the girl's progress.  The other smaller animals cease drinking and scatter into hiding. Lili sits on the grass in the center of the clearing, spreading her gown around her.  She smiles at the staring unicorns. The male unicorn grows agitated.  His nostrils flare; the strong neck arches.  Sunlight gleams on the shaft of his golden horn as he prances across the stream to the meadow sending multi-hued clouds of butterflies aloft from the flowers underfoot. Lili smiles at the nimble dancing of the unicorn, seemingly drawn to her by an invisible lead.

Sticking straight out of the heaped treasure before him, a splendid sword-hilt catches his eye.  It seems to glow with some inner force.  The golden pommel gleams. Jack grasps the sword with both hands, rising to his feet as he draws it from the pile of jewels.  The blade is nea long as he is, awesome and shining with its own special light.  Jack holds it in front of him like a crucifier in a religious procession.  The light from the blade shines on his face, imbuing his spirit with courage and resolution. Gump and Oona continue to annoy the dragon, swinging around his head and taunting him with the insignificant blows.  The dragon lashes out at them, ignoring Jack. Jack swings the mighty, shining sword back over his shoulder and rushes forward, a fierce WAR-CRY issuing fro his snarling mouth.  With one mighty swing, like a woodsman chopping an oak, he strikes at the dragon's hind leg, severing it at the joint. The dragon's WAIL of pain is abrupt and piercing.  Blood fountains from the amputated limb as the giant serpent sways for balance. The dragon falls forward, toppling like a felled tree directly toward Jack.  The Green Man stands his ground, holding his gleaming sword above his head with both hands The dragon impales himself on the tip, driving the keen blade deep into his breast as he crashes to the ground. The sword is wrenched from Jack's hand and he jumps clear the dragon writhing on his back in his death throes. The mighty tail continues to lash about, wreaking havoc among the treasure.  Jack nimbly avoids the random slashing and leaps up onto the dragon's scaled stomach. With a mighty tug, he draws his sword from the beast's chest.  A geyser of steaming blood follows the blade. The talons on the dragon's forelegs grasp and clench spasmodically but Jack ducks between them, avoiding the terrible claws.  With a single backhand swing, he lops th dragon's snarling head from his neck.  Copious quantities of boiling blood flush across the spread jewels. Jack lifts his sword above his head and lets out an exultant victory CRY.  Above him, Gump and Oona CHEER, shouting \"Bravo\" and \"hooray!\" The dragon's head lies in a pool of blood, the forked tongue still probing the air.  The great green eye slides closed.",

Colorful tents stand under frozen trees, pennants snapping in the icy wind.  A small army of elves, imps, goblins, gnomes and faeries has gathered, all decked out in various odd bits of armor recovered from the dragon's lair.  Groups of these tiny folk are engaged in martial training, practicing with swords, lances and bows. As we MOVE through the camp amid this mock mayhem, certai isolated incidents attract our attention: Two goblins duel furiously, sweating and panting under th weight of their ill-matched armor.  They are clearly exhausted.  As the other elves continue slashing at one another, these two take time out; one leaning against a tree trunk while the other folds his arms in repose.  But their swords CONTINUE to duel, alone in mid-air, the blades crashing together MAGICALLY like iron birds. Another group practices archery, aiming their tiny arrows at a straw scarecrow some distance away.  They are extremely accurate, puncturing the dummy in a dozen vital spots.  When the last arrow strikes, instead of retrievin them, the faeries stand their ground.  One-by-one, the arrows PULL FREE from the scarecrow and FLY back unaided through the air to land safely in their owner's quivers. Two huge knights, each over seven feet, slug it out in full armor with battle axes.  They bash away at one- another, until a fearsome blow literally cuts one in half The upper portion of the bisected knight topples to the ground with a LOUD CLANG.  The two armored legs remain erect, swaying slightly like trees in the wind.  Suddenly a tiny head appears above the left cuisse.  It is an elf. He is LAUGHING.  Another elf pops his head out of the right-hand cuisse and the two \"legs\" hop off in opposite directions. The fallen armor also comes apart:  one gnome in the breastplate; another lifting the helm from the gorget. The victorious \"knight\" likewise begins to disassemble, revealing a number of LAUGHING elves within, like clowns performing a carnival prank.",
