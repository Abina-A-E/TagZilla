She takes out her golden key and considers the doors. Eac one clad in smooth gold, with identical locks. The wicker basket starts to shake furiously. Ofelia opens it. The Fairies fly out. They buzz around the three niches, like flies around hone They fan their wings repeatedly, vibrating, communicating sniffing the gold doors. Stepping back to let the Fairies investigate, Ofelia knoc over a platter of green grapes. She picks them up and puts them back on the table. One of the grapes remains on the floor. The Green Fairy stops in front of the door in the middle, announcing its decision. Ofelia goes to the door and puts the key in the lock. OFELIA. No- It's this one- -she goes to the adjoining door, sticks the key in the lo \fand turns it. CLACK. She opens the door and reaches through the doorway to tak whatever is there. Her hand nears a package, about 16 centimeters long, wrap ina dirty rag. Ofelia looks around: nothing has happened. All is calm. T Pale Man is immobile. Ofelia readies to exit, but then she spots a plate full o ripe grapes: so many of them!! She looks back at the eerie, sitting figure: immobile and seemingly lifeless. The Fairies warn her repeatedly, tryi to prevent her from eating any grapes. But the girl sneak picks one up and eats it. Unseen by her- The Pale Man lifts his head and grabs the human eyeballs from the metallic plate in front of him. He introduces the eyeballs into twin stigmatas in his pal and uses his hands to look around, splaying his fingers l excited peacock feathers as he discovers- -Ofelia eating yet another grape. The Pale Man jerks toward her, in spastic, disembodied steps. He crouches like an animal ready to pounce. Ofelia turns just in time. The Pale Man roars. The Fairie fly at him and attack! Flailing his arms, the monster turns over the table, dump all the food. Swatting and snapping, he eats two of the Fairies. They HOWL as he bites down... Ofelia runs, carrying the precious package. The Green Fai follows her. The Pale Man comes after her.",
