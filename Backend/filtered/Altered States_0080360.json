We may notice eight EEG leads issuing out of his scalp. \fthru NARRATION (cont'd) 6 -- The others reported experiences ranging from pleasant to exhilarating. The SCREEN suddenly goes utterly BLACK -- NARRATION (cont'd) It seemed that depriving a man of external stimuli simply triggered a whole new set of internal stimuli -- Suddenly, the briefest of IMAGES flicks across the BLACK SCREEN, a sudden narrow band of color, mud-brown, much too brief for us to identify anything except that it happened -- NARRATION (cont'd) Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic evidence especially interesting -- CLOSEUP of JESSUP'S monastic face again, for identifi- cation purposes -= NARRATION (cont'd) Within minutes after the activating experience, well organized alpha waves of forty to fifty micro-volts, eleven to twelve seconds, appeared in all regions +-- Again, a fleeting band of IMAGERY, a broader BAND, lasting just long enough for us to see that the grains in the wood that form the interior walls of the tank, behind the black aluminum interior lining of the tank, are SINUATING, as if they were alive -- NARRATION (cont'd) -- After fifteen minutes, there was an increase in the alpha amplitude, as much as thirty to seventy micro-volts, predominantly in the frontal and central regions -- The SCREEN suddenly, briefly, takes on a GRAY sheen, and then, as abruptly, it foes BLACK again -- NARRATION (cont'd) At the half hour mark, rhythmical waves of seven to eight seconds appeared, and then, suddenly -- ANOTHER FLEETING IMAGE: too quick to be really dis tinguishable, a vivid, baked--oranged FLASH with some~ thing WHITE and RED in it.

This EEG pattern was startling similar to those of Zen priests in zazen. Dr. Jessup founa this fascinating, and, one Saturday afternoon in April 1967, he decided to try the experience for himself -- The IMAGES begin to come with increasing quickness now -- IMAGE: A stunted, dwarfed FIG TREE, shedding it's fruit - IMAGE: A rocky TERRAIN, the barren Judean hills -- IMAGE: The ANIMAL we saw so briefly before, this time perhaps recognizable as a lamb, a white lamb, with seven eyes and seven horns. Its throat is slashed. It is dripping blood -- IMAGE: The entire SCREEN is suddenly WHITE, radiant white, near-to-blinding white -- SOUND: A sudden blare of CATHEDRAL NUSIC, organ music, a snatch of Bach. A second later, it stops -- IMAGE: A twisted Biblical street, empty, a crooked, narrow, cobbled street, twisting between the pitted white walls of small stone buildings -- IMAGE: The SCREEN is utterly BLACK again -- SOUND: Jessup's BREATHING -- IMAGE: A fluttering image of a GREEN VERONICA, one of those religious handkerchiefs with the face of Christ painted on it, a chalk-white face of an anguished Christ with little red kewpie doll spots on his cheeks, a crown of thorns on his brow -- IMAGE: An expanse of surreal landscape -- an endless stretch of brilliantly white beach -~ IMAGE: The sacrificial WHITE LAMB again, this time lying on a rude stone altar.

IMAGE: Beads of red BLOOD dripping from above against a white SCREEN -- IMAGE: A hailstorm of HAIL and BLOOD -- IMAGE: The SCREEN is BLACK again, the blackness of space. A humming, droning SOUND, resonating, getting louder, the drone of primal energy. A PINSPOT of twinkling light, a distant star it would seem moving toward us. After a moment, we recognize it isn't a star, but an enormous bird, a black bird. It seems to have a human face, the face of a suffering saint, an agonized, martyr's face, complete with halo. The bird is ba, the eternal soul of pharaonic Egypt. The face is St. Sebastian's. It veers in its flight and comes swooping horribly at us, filling the screen with its enormous black wings -- IMAGE: The rude stone altar with the sacrificial white LAMB on it. The blood drips from its slashed throat. PAN DOWN the altar to the ground where a large pool of blood has formed. A YOUNG WOMAN kneels at the edge of the pool of blood. Her back is toward us. She is naked, is washing a white Biblical robe in the pool of blood. She becomes aware that she is being watched. She looks over her shoulder at us. She is exquisitely beautiful. She stands, faces us, a strikingly white young woman, holding her robe, which, despite its bathing in blood, is white and pure. PAN UP the altar to the sacrificial lamb lying atop it. Its throat is still cut, its blood still dripping, but its face is now the face of Christ that was on the green Veronica, the chalk-white face with the red kewpie doll spots on its cheeks and the crown of thorns on its head. IMAGE: Total, silent BLACKNESS. Suddenly, an EXPLOSION, a shattering flash of brilliant whiteness fills the SCREEN. A high-pitched SCREAMING DRONE of energy. Waves of different colors pulsate and throb across the SCREEN. One such wave bends, wrinkles, pinches up, and the first particle of matter is created. The SCREEN is instantly filled with innumerable FLASHES, as the most primitive bits of matter smash and whirl maniacally. Flares of collision. The blinding luminoslty of an earlier Universe fades into the soft glow of a cooling cloud of primordial hydrogen -- IMAGE: A small room with bare walls. Jessup and the beautiful young Woman in a momentary fever of sexuality. He has seized her from behind. His hands clutch her breasts. He ravishes her neck with kisses and biting. She has thrown her head back, her neck arched in voluptuous pleasure -- \fthru thru 10 11 12 13 5. 1 IMAGE: A quick series of flickering images as Jessup thru experiences an ontological dematuration -- Jessup as embryo of eight months, then as of two weeks, then as a zygote, then as a single original cell; and then back up again until, with a SCREAH, Jessup re~experiences the moment of his birth, his expulsion from his mother's uterus, gasping, suffocating, screaming -- IMAGE: The small room with bare walls. A BED. On the bed, Jessup and the Young Woman, naked, in the throes of exuberant intercourse. Jessup plunging, thrusting. Jessup's sweating face, his eyes wide open, his mouth agape, as if this experience was one of shattering metapnhysicality. Beneath nim, the white body of the Young Woman twists, responds, her legs lock themselves around Jessup's waist. Her head twists this way and that. Her face, we suddenly notice, is the face of Christ on the handkerchief, chalk-white with red spots on her cheeks and a crown of thorns on her head. CAMERA MOVES IN on the Christ-face. OVER this, the SOUND of Jessup's breathing, the short, staccato panting of a man on the verge of orgasm -- 7 OMITTED thru 10 We are suddenly back inside the tank. Jessup's white 11 mask of a face, eyes closed, cushioned in the BLACKNESS Of the interior of the tank. OVER this, Jessup's dis- embodied sexual PANTING continues, rising to crescendo. At which point, his body suddenly thrashes; his legs kick and splash the black water on which he floats. The white mask of a face remains serene and unciianged.

The fact that a small chain of amino acids, ACTH four to seven, a natural substance of the body, is instrumental in fixing memory is, I think, particularly interesting.

The room DRONES with ENERGY. The space RESONATES and RIPPLES. Jessup's form, still recognizably human, seems to be caught in a PINCH of ENERGY WAVES and temperature differences, twisting and swirling around him, changing his coloration from LUMINOUS WHITE to FOGGY INFRA-RED to the BURNING RED of ultra- violet radiation to blurred CHIARCSCURO BLACKS and GRAYS of the quality of x-rays. \f205 thru 210 211 107.

Not fifteen seconds have elapsed since the first explosion. In Emily's arms, Jessup's form THROBS and CRACKS and RESONATES, and he SCREAMS his anguished primal SHRIEK again. His eyes stare blindly out on some existential and unspeakable horror. Then, the fluctuating ex- tensions of matter that still retain the barely dis- tinguishable shape of arms flow out and unfold them- selves around his wife, and they kneel together on the flooded floor of the room, two terrified figures alone in the dense black spaceless DRONE of energy, elutching each other against the horror of human origins. Abruptly, the demented throbbing HUM of entropic forces stons. The COSMIC BLACK recedes as if it had been snatched up. Emily holds pressed against her the now entirely reconstituted naked form of her husband. They remain locked in their desperate embrace amid the wreckage of the tank room. Fragments of the wooden tank are everywhere, the smaller pieces floating listlessly in the several inches of water that covers the floor. Jessup is no longer screaming. There is NO SOUND at ali; the silence is palpable. Emily locks down at the ashen face resting on her breast; he is breathing but manifestly in coma.

The blanket falls from her shoulders to the floor at her feet. Her arms begin to bulge and swell and discolor. A jagged crack appears on her forearm and shoots up the length of her arm as if it were splitting open. She slowly forces her arm up as if to show it to her husband. It is now a stump, and even that stump is losing its definition as the lines that define it be- come wave-like and seem to melt into the shrieking air. \f230 thru 247 120. She feels a massive shock just inside her skull above 230 her eyes. A RED-HOT FLAME erupts from her bowels. thru She seems to be burning alive. Her EYES DISAPPEAR. 247 She would scream except her mouth has disappeared as well. The SCREEN has become total, impenecrable BLACKNESS. Then, out of the blackness, we HEAR a distant echo of a scream, lightyears away in the ultimate blackness. It grows louder. It is no longer a scream; it is now rather a roar of rage, the fury of a raging animal. Light begins to penetrate the total blackness. Forms begin to take shape. We begin to recognize Jessup's human form, flickering in and out of the madness of all his other shapes, reasserting itself. The blackness is all gone now. ‘We are back in the living room of Jessup's flat. He is standing, a completely human form again, naked, as immobile, enmarbled as a statue, stark white. He is staring at his wife, who is disintegrating into the shapeless anti-matter that had been his condition the night before. With a shocking wrench of effort, he takes a step toward her, forcing humanness into himself. One step, two -~ he reaches out to embrace the shapless- ness of his wife. It is instantly, abruptly over. The drone, the lunacy of illusion, the whole shattering moment is done. What we see, standing in the sunlight in the middle of their living room is a young married couple -- a slight, light-haired man of thirty-seven, beginning to bald just a bit but looking boyish at the moment in his Jeans and T-shirt; and a slim, gracefully naked young woman, her face pressed against her husband, her arms wrapped around his waist, a pair of young living humans, standing embraced in the white sunlight of their living room.",
