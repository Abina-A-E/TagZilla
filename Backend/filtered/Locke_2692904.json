Huge arc lights and floodlights illuminate the scene and men are hard at work A group of men are in discussion in a pool of light. Ther is a conversation, then one of the men breaks off and tak call on his cellphone. He is distant, not even the focal point of the shot. He puts his finger in his ear to hear call more clearly. He is too far away for us to see his reactions or expression but, when he cuts the call, he wa directly toward the car and the other men turn to watch h go. As he gets closer we see he wears a tie and heavy boots a heavy coat. He wears a hard hat. He finds a key fob and hits it. The lights inside the car glow in response. The man gets into the driver’s seat. He is in his thirtie a face made of stone and unused to expressions of emotion This is IVAN LOCKE. He sits in the driver’s seat for a few moments. He takes breath and we might guess (or we might not) that he has j had some important news. Is he scared, angry? He takes out his cellphone and looks, deciding whether or to make a call. He checks his watch. He decides there isn time for the call. He puts the phone away quickly and fir the engine. He shifts gear and reverses. We stay with him and will st with him intensely for the rest of the story. The car bumps over rough ground as Ivan heads for the big secure gates that open out onto the street. The construct site is massive and it takes a while to reach the edge of Trucks rumble and generators roar. This is Ivan’s world. The gates are opened by a guy in a high viz jacket. Ivan reaches the kerb of the road and indicates right as a ref But he doesn’t pull away. He realizes that this time he must choose which way he wi go. He has a decision to make but he is a man who makes a hundred hard decisions a day. Even so, he takes time. A massive truck pulls up inches behind him and its headli fill Ivan’s car. Ivan continues to make his decision as h indicator ticks away the seconds. The truck hoots its baleful horn, the voice of fate. Ivan hits the indicator to indicate left instead of right He turns left and joins light evening traffic. \fLocke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 3.",
