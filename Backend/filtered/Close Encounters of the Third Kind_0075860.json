We had just passed Mill and she said, \"Look at that light.\" There was a sort of dim glow to our right and rear, She said, \"That must be one of those UFOs.\" I was just about to tell her it must be a helicopter when it pulled alongside of us and I could see it wasn't no helicopter at all. It was gliding very smoothly about 500 yards to cur right, About 50 yards above’ the trees. That would be north, There was ne doubting it cause it was the only light in the sky. At first I figured it muse be an illusion, I pulled the car to the shoulder and cut the engine to get a better look, Then I ‘heard it--nothing at all.

It looked like two huge pot covers placed atop each other...like this. It was made out of a dull grey metallic substance, like pewter or platinum, Right on top there was a raised portion, like a hub, you know, and where the two pot covers met there was a thin row, not a row exactly, more like a continuous band of blue light. It slowly kept coming closer and I wanted to run but my legs wouldn't move, I didn't know what was going to happen, Later Janice said she tried to start the car but it wouldn't turn over.
