Pause. We HEAR a record drop and begin playing a light classical melody. The SUPERIMPOSED TITLES BEGIN. After a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them, past a low table, and around a couch to the window curtai The feet pause there for a moment. A piece of heavy window cord drops INTO FRAME. We FOLLOW as it is dragged along to the low table. Then the feet move over to a larg ornate desk. The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME. Pause. The feet walk over to a chair by the wall. It is picked up, carried to the center of the room, and carefully placed. Pause. The feet get up onto the chair and the CAMERA RISES to their level. They shuffle about for a moment. At an appropriate musical break the CREDITS STOP. Suddenly the feet knock over the chair and drop into space. They kick about for a bit, then go slack and still The FINAL CREDITS are SUPERED OVER the suspended appendag while the music comes to a lilting conclusion. As we HEAR the record player turn itself off, the CAMERA BEGINS a half circle tour around the hanging feet and stops at the heels. Pause. Outside we HEAR a woman's footsteps approaching and we change focus as the door to the den opens. Through the blurred hanging feet we see a tall, middle-aged, fashionably dressed woman enter and we PAN with her as she walks to the desk. This is MRS. CHASEN. She seems rather tired and preoccupied as she begins to remove her long white gloves. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS a vertical rise up the side of the hanging corpse until we are watching Mrs. Chasen over his left shoulder. The rope and his stretched neck frame the right side of the SCREEN We hold. Mrs. Chasen puts down her gloves and looks up. (NOTE: THE ABOVE IS ALL ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT.)",

Well, on the floor above they had the Chemistry Lab and I had to stay in and clean it up. So I thought I'd doa little experimenting. I got all this stuff out and began mixing it up. It was very scientific. I was measuring the amounts. Well, suddenly there was this big fizzing sound and this white kind of porridge stuff began erupting out of the beaker, and moving along the desk and falling onto the floor. It was making an awful mess. So I got the hose to try to spray it haroldandmaudehomepage.com/xhigginnsscreenplay txt 59/105 \f3/6/12 haroldandmaudehomepage.com/xhigginnsscreenplay. txt into the sink. I turned on the water and - POW! There was this massive explosion. Knocked me down. Blew out the floor. Boards and brick and flames leaping up. Singed my hair. Smoke everywhere. I got up, then this sound like bombs going off. It was the fireworks in the room below. And all this stuff came flying out the hole. PACHAU! Skyrockets and pinwheels. And fire balls all whizzing and bouncing. And I was just standing there stunned - I couldn't believe it - just watching - being pelted by all these little pellets - turns out to be the goddamn popcorn spewed up from below. The whole place was a crazy inferno with the rockets and everything, and I couldn't get to the door. But behind me was this old laundry chute, so I hopped in that and slid down that to the basement. When I got outside I saw that the whole top of the building was on fire and, of course, it was pandemonium with people running around and fire alarms ringing. So I decided to go home. When I get there my mother is having this big party so I creep up the back stairs to my room. Then there is this ring on the doorbell. It's the police. I creep over to the banister to see what they say, and they tell my mother that I had been killed in a fire at school. Well, everyone got very quiet.",
