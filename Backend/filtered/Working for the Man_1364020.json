I'd talk to my Mom, but  she'd say Dad was in the basement  working on his wooden toys. He sold  his hardware store and retired just  so he could do that, it turned out  to be a pretty good business, little  toy stores all over the country bought  his old fashioned wooden toys --  then at Christmas, he'd send one to  Richie and one to my sister's kids...  and he'd always keep a few to give  'em away whenever he met a kid.  Anyway, when Mom said he was busy in  the basement, I always figured that  he just didn't want to talk to me...  sure he taught me to play hockey,  but he also beat the crap out of me  when I was thirteen, and to this  day, I never knew why... what had I  done? So it just seemed better if he  pretended to be working on his toys  when I called. I think we spend our  whole lives trying to please our  fathers, but I was beginning to  believe... you can't. And now, I  guess it was too late. Oh, well, oh,  shit, now Mom's dead, Dad's got...  what did they call it, Old Timer's  disease... Oh, well, oh, shit, life  is a bitch, and then you die. Ho.  Ho.
