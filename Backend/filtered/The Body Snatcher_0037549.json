Evidently, Josep dead enough to suit him and he lets go his grip.  FULL SHOT as Gray gets to his feet. He crosses the room t cupboard, opens it and takes out a square of folded canva He starts back toward Joseph and stops on the way to pick Joseph's glass from the taboret. He drinks the remainder the liquor in it. Gray kneels down beside Joseph and begi to wrap the canvas about the body. Suddenly, a thought strikes him, and he puts his hand in Joseph's coat pocket fishes out the money he had given him. He begins wrapping canvas around the body again.",
