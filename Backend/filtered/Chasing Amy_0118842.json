Alyssa looks over at him and  offers a caught smile. 2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE,  throwing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up with a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances at them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the box, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate  their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming  insertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the \"I know, I  know,\" fashion. 3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to  Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes  to light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having trouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he  grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with  his teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.   Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He  then continues with his display. 4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a comic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa  her change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his  card game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can  comes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a  check off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The  Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly, 5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking. She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. Holden smiles to himself.",

I know this will probably queer  our friendship - no pun intended - but  I had to say it, because I've never  felt this before, and I like who I am  because of it.  And if bringing it to  light means we can't hang out anymore,  then that hurts me.

All I ask is that you  not suppress that - at least for ten  minutes - and try to dwell in it  before you dismiss it.   There isn't another soul on this  fucking planet who's ever made me the  person I am when I'm with you, and I  would risk this friendship for the  chance to take it to the next plateau.   Because it's there between you and me.   You can't deny that.

There  was no example set for me in the world  of male/female relation ships.

So I didn't.  And by leaving my  options open, I was branded 'gay',  which to me was no big deal - labels  are labels, you know?  They define  what you do, not who you are, I guess.

Alyssa gave him.   It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to  her and shakes his head 'no'. 2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky  plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL  '96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and  over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.   Alyssa sticks her tongue at him. 3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon  off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's  reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick  porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the  old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands,  putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The  old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the  tape herself, 4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the  park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's  talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She  begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.   He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the  Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs. 5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the  waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden again, this time with the painting hung completely upside down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze. 6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There are penciled pages on it with a note that says \"Hanging  out with Alyssa today.  Holden\".  Banky crumples it up  and throws it across the room. 7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then  that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.   She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile  crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.

She fucking drops to her knees, and  just starts sucking him off right in  front of me!  Like I wasn't even there  man!  I almost died!  But that's not  the fucked up part - the fucked up  part was Rick, man - right in the  middle of it, he turns to me and he's  pointing at her and he says \"Cohee.\"   Just like that - \"Cohee.\"  So I'm like  I'll give it a shot.  And I start  pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz  I figure any second she's gonna turn  around and belt me in the mouth,  right?  But yo, check this shit out -  she's all into it man!  She don't try  to stop me or nothing!  She's                  all wet and shit, and I just went to  work, know what I'm saying?  Me and  Rick are going to town on this crazy  bitch, and she's just loving it, all  moaning and shit!  It was fucked up!
