Uh, two elderly  women are at a Catskills mountain  resort, and one of 'em says: \"Boy, the  food at this place is really terrible.\"  The other one says, \"Yeah, I know, and  such ... small portions.\" Well, that's  essentially how I feel about life.  Full  of loneliness and misery and suffering  and unhappiness, and it's all over much  too quickly.  The-the other important  joke for me is one that's, uh, usually  attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think  it appears originally in Freud's wit and  its relation to the unconscious.  And it  goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ...  \"I would never wanna belong to any club  that would have someone like me for a  member.\" That's the key joke of my adult  life in terms of my relationships with  women.  Tsch, you know, lately the  strangest things have been going  through my mind, 'cause I turned forty,  tsch, and I guess I'm going through a  life crisis or something, I don't know.  I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.   I'm not one o' those characters, you know.  Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's  about the worst you can say about me.
