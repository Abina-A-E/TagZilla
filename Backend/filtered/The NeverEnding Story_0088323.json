Bastian quickly sits up as if awakening from a nightmare. He looks at a picture of his mom with a sigh and then he picks up the book beside him and marks his spot. CUT TO: Kitchen. Bastians father is working on some sort of concoction in the kitchen blender, while Bastian sits at the dining table straining to open jelly for his toast. They exchange a good morning between each other, but they are relatively quiet. Father: Morning Bastian Bastian: Morning Dad Bastian continues to struggle with the jar until his hand hurts. His father turns to him and gives him a hand. He seems to easily open the jar. As Bastians father returns to his task of the morning drink concoction Bastian breaks the silence.

The Rockbiter makes a boyscouts honor sign. Rockbiter: | swear it wasn't me. Nighthob: Hah ! Heck no. Tiny: I think | know what it was, tell us more. Rockbiter: Near my home there used to be a beautiful lake, but then it was gone. Tiny: Did the lake dry up? Rockbiter: No, it just wasn't there anymore. Nothing was there anymore. Not even a dried up lake. Tiny: Ahole ? Rockbiter: No, a hole would be something. Nah, it was nothing. And it got bigger and bigger. First there was no lake anymore and then finally, no rocks. Nighthob: \fHah! If he keeps stuffing his face like that, soon there won't be any rocks left here either! (Nighthob complains to the little man. As he starts to walk away, the little man grabs him.) Tiny: Nighthob, this could be serious! Rockbiter, what you have told us is also occurring where | live in the west ! A strange sort of Nothing is destroying everything.

Rockbiter: My people are sending me to the Ivory Tower, to the Empress for help Nighthob and Tiny: We are.. Tiny: We are on the same mission. After all, if the Empress can't save us, who could?
