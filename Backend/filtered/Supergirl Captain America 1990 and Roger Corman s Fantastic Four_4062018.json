Giant Fir branches in the lush forest undulate, almost dancing in the soft wind. A BLACK-TAILED BUCK makes its way through the dense woods The deer walks to the bank, dips its mouth into the river and drinks. Tall grass parts and out of the morning fog comes a young man, completely COVERED IN MUD, a massive, serrated hunti knife in his hands. This is BODEVAN. He's 18, with wispy hair down to his shoulders. The deer turns its head, sensing something. Bo freezes - perfectly camouflaged in the tall grass. The deer sniffs the air, but as Bo is covered in mud and animal skins, it smells nothing. It relaxes, drinking fro the river again. Bo exhales, silently. In a flash, Bo leaps out of the grass and in one continuo motion, tackles the deer and slices the animal’s carotid artery. The deer does nothing more than flinch, blood spu from it’s neck and it just folds, hemorrhagic shock takin over. It's a perfect kill. Bo watches and the animal takes its final breath. Then he signals and five KIDS glide into the clearing. Th range in age from 14 to 6, all have long, unruly hair, di faces, and wear, over the usual kid's clothes of t-shirts jeans, what looks like animal skins. They are: two twin 1 year old girls, KIELYR and VESPYR; RELLIAN, a boy of 13; ZAJA, a 8-year old girl; and lastly, NAI, a 6-year old bo The other kids surround Bo, staring down at the fallen de (CONTINUED)",
