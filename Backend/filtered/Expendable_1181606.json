Across the street is a STATUE of GENERAL GARZA on a TEN F PEDESTAL. The intimidated LOCALS jump aside as the CONVOY approache intersection. An OLD MAN struggling to push a RICKETY CAR full of junk out of the way, passes in front of the MAIN HORNS blare. The OLD MAN stands petrified. This disrespec definitely not tolerated. TWO LARGE AMERICAN OPERATIVES, dressed in khaki, leap fro the LEAD JEEP and berate the OLD MAN. Stepping out of the SECOND JEEP is PAINE. The big man is wearing a conspicuous SHOULDER HOLSTER. In his thick hand an equally thick, short BLACK CLUB attached to a LEATHER STRAP. PAINE motions to the SOLDIERS who pour out of the TRUCK a commence to shoving people aside, then SMASHING the OLD M cart. The TWO AMERICAN OPERATIVES push the OLD MAN and send him sprawling to the sidewalk as the SOLDIERS RE-BOARD the TRANSPORT TRUCK. The LOCALS share in the man’s pain, but terrified to show any outward emotion. PAINE climbs back his JEEP and the motorcade is GONE.",
