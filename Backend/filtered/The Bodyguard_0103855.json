He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question- ingly, as if to ask, \"Had enough?\" Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall. He holds it in front of him threateningly. Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony. It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances at Tony.",
