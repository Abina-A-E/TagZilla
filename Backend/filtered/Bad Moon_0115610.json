Cove with fur, it stands upright, on its hind legs, with its f legs wrapped around the tree trunk, held together by Uncl Ted's handcuffs.

Its face distends in a wolf-like snout. Two -grotesquely long fangs protrude from its exposed gums. I fangs are sharp and very dangerous-looking. It has been trying to cut through the tree trunk with them, and has gnawed a big hunk out of the tree before giving up on the idea. The Werewolf hasn't seen Thor yet. The German Shepherd backs slowly, silently, into the surrounding bushes, then edges in for a closer look. The Werewolf is chained to the lone tree in the clearing, the moon, now high in the sky, beams down on it like a spotlight.
