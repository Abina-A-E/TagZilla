His helmet is lacquered and shines with four silver stars. He wears a tailored tunic, with four stars on each shoulder, thirty brightly hued decorations on the left breast, five horizontal and three diagonal gold stripes on the sleeve. Beneath the tunic, he wears a shirt with four stars on each lapel, making a total of twenty stars. A vivid blue sash is draped across his breast, parallel to one of yellow, A red collar sash weighted by another medal hangs from his neck The rest of his costume consists of a gold-buckled belt, with his ivory-handled pistols on either side, riding breeches, boots, and a riding crop.

When you were kids you all admired the champion marble player, the fastest runner, the big league ballplayers, the toughest boxers. Americans love a . Winner and do not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost, and will never lose a war, for the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans, An army is a team. It lives, sleeps, eats, fights as a team. This individu- ality stuff is a lot of crap. The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real battle than they do about a sock full of silt. We have the finest food, equipment, the best spirit and men in the world. Why, by God, I actually pity those poor bastards we're going against -- by God, I do, We won't just shoot the bastards. We're going to cut out their living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun bastards by the bushel. Many of you boys are wondering whether you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it; I can assure you you will all do your duty. The Nazis are the enemy.
