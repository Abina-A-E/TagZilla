More John Wa than Jack Webb, he weighs exactly what he weighed when he joined the Marines twenty five years ago. Next to General Newhouse is his aide, Lt. PETER VEILLERS. Veillers has spent too much time behind a desk filling ou paper work.  He looks too soft for combat. Each Marine salutes Newhouse as he passes. Gunnery Sergeant Martin L. RACKIN salutes as he passes, followed by Sgt. Breen, Corporal Horman, and Sgt. Delmar. When Delmar salutes, we see the tattoo on his arm again. The cold blooded killers who knocked off Vargas and the D Dealers are United States Marines!",
