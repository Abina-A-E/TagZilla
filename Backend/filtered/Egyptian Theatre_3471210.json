Sinuhe, kneeling there, is bleeding him, using the instrument of his time, of copper and stone. Nearby is the small, wooden, portable box in which he carries his instruments and medicines. Sinuhe also observes the scene. A SYRIAN SLAVE MERCHANT, unctuous and fawning, is offering for the inspection of the Noble a string of WOMEN SLAVES. These slaves are of all ages, countries, colors of skin - and the action of the selling goes like this: As the merchant brings the women and girls forward for inspection, they arrive in such a way that we see their faces, can judge their nationalities, beauty or lack of it, their ages. But as they are presented to the Noble their backs are to camera. Before the Noble, they lift aside their garments, so that he may inspect them as one would cattle. The Woble indicates with a gesture of his ivory-handled fly- whisk his decision. All who are presented at the opening of this scene the Noble waves away with indifference.

All carry their proper insignia of office -- projecting above these backs are military weapons, staffs and the tall ostrich fans of the most high, most near the throne. Arriving at the foot of the throne, camera stops. Tethered there is a lion, which lies on the floor. Camera pans slowly up, picks up the golden sandals of Pharaoh and his Queen, then their legs, then themselves. HOREMHEB is standing stiffly before his throne chair, impassively surveying the multitude. On his head is the double crown of Egypt, tall, hat-like, red and white - with the sacred snake~head, the Uraesus. His hands carry the lash and the crook, the black and white crook in ceremonial posi- tion, just underneath his jeweled collar. Many charms in the shape of stiff emblems and variously kmotted and looped ribbons hang down from his hips. On the wall be- hind him there is a magnificent mural of a battle scene which shows Horemheb bloodily slaying Hittites. (The decorations of this room are all very military; the atmos phere of this court is predominantly military.) At 45 this warrior-King has not lost his military carriage; his physique is magnificent. His face, furrowed by battle is also eroded by care and secret unhappiness -- his soul is sick. His queen, BAKETAMON, is already seated in her chair of their double throne. She, also, is bedecked with full ceremonial clothing, wig and jewelry. A little more than a year older than Horemheb, she is still a most beautiful woman, with finely chiseled, aristocratic fea~ tures - showing the inbreeding decadence of a long line of royalty. She is completely impassive; her dark eyes have no sparkle but look ahead like the unseeing eyes of a statue of a goddess -- she is a woman who has totally withdrawn from life.

Ir. general pattern, it is an open courtyard surrounded by a high wall with a pyloned gate. There are no dark and mysterious places in this temple. There are no idols, no representations of the fearful gods. Akhnaton's god is represented by two pure symbols. One of these is a rather large Cross of Life, the other is a column of the type we saw when he worshipped on the plains outside Thebes - the type of shaft we call \"Cleopatra's Needle,” On the walls there are pictorial decorations. Some of these show the fuller representations of the symbol of Akhnatonts god. In these, god is represented as the disc of the sun from the lower perimeter of which hands reach down in an attitude of benediction, some of these hands holding the Cross of Life. Sometimes scenes of Pharaoh and his Queen and Pharaoh and his whole family are shown with this symbol. There are altars at the bases of the shaft and of the cross. There, is a religious ceremony in progress, and worship- ers, most of whom are of the middle and lower classes, and all of whom wear the Cross of Life, are bringing offerings to the altars - such offerings being chiefly fruits and flowers. The ceremony is being supervised by priests, who are mostly rather young men and are not the fat and oily fellows of the priesthood of the old gods. The worshipers are singing a hymn - one composed by Akhnaton himself. Although this music continues over several succeeding shots, the complete lyrics are given here for convenience: Thy dawning is beautiful in the horizon of heaven, Oh, living Aton, beginning of life! When Thou risest in the eastern horizon of heaven, Thou fillest every land with Thy beauty The two lands of Egypt are in daily festivity, Awake and standing on their feet, Por Thou hast raised them up] The birds flutter in their marshes, Their wings uplifted in adoration te Thee, All the sheep dance upon their feet, All the winged things fly, They live when Thou hast shone upon them.
