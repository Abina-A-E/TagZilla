But as the dog keeps running we see signs of conflict. A spear, half imbedded in the earth, rises at an angle. A bronze helmet, cracked and bloodied, lies on its side. The dog pauses to sniff the helmet then continues his search. Finally he stops, hackles on his back rising, ears pricked up. He growls, and we see what the dog sees. Dozens of CROWS have descended into a shallow ravine. They squabble and peck, clustered around something on the ground. The dog growls louder and charges at the crows. The black birds flap away to safety, shrieking in protest. A DEAD SOLDIER lies facedown in the ravine. Whatever armor he wore was stripped away, leaving his body to the elements. The dog walks slowly to the dead man, sniffing at the corpse's hands. The dog whines and licks the man's fingers. Something in the air disturbs the dog, who looks up. And now we hear it, faintly, in the distance. HOOF BEATS and chariot wheels, marching men, the clank of bronze armor and weaponry. The dog runs, abandoning his dead master.",

Achilles casts aside the shield and keeps coming. Boagrius unsheathes his tremendous bronze sword. He opens his mouth, lets loose a battle cry, and charges at Achilles. When Boagrius raises his sword, Achilles lunges forward with terrifying speed. It does not seem possible that he could close the gap between them so quickly, but he does, thrusting his sword straight through Boagrius' breastplate. Achilles pulls his sword from the giant's chest and continues walking toward the Thessalonian line, never looking back. Boagrius stares down at the hole in his breastplate. Blood pumps out, pouring down the polished bronze. He topples over. The Mycenaean Army ERUPTS with exultant victory cries. Achilles now stands in front of the massed Thessalonian troops. He searches from face to face. None of the soldiers are willing to make eye contact with him. Finally Triopas steps out of the ranks.",

Hector doesn't give them a chance to recover. He pounces, sword flashing, and both men fall to the temple floor. Achilles watches from the top step. Hector begins running up the stairs.

Hector ducks below the axe and lunges forward with his sword, but Ajax -- quick despite his size -- sidesteps, grabs the smaller man in a bear hug and squeezes. Hector turns red. The sword falls from Hector's hand. Ajax grins. Hector slams his helmeted head forward, butting Ajax in the face. Ajax staggers back, blood spraying from his nose, his axe falling to the ground. Hector struggles to regain his equilibrium. Ajax growls and launches himself at the prince. Hector snatches a spear off the ground and positions it just as Ajax dives at him. The spear pierces Ajax's armor, driving through his belly and out his back. Hector holds the shaft steady. Ajax stares down at his wound. He seems more irritated than anything else. Ajax places his two big hands on the spear shaft, right where the spear enters his body. He breaks the spear in two, snapping the solid wood like a twig. Half a spear still sticking out his back, Ajax swings the shaft, clobbering Hector in the side of the head, sending the horsehair-plumed helmet flying. (CONTINUED)",

Ajax backhands Hector with the broken spear shaft, cracking the prince in the jaw and dropping him again. Ajax grabs Hector, hoists him upright and begins throttling the prince. Ajax spits a great wad of blood and smiles, teeth washed red. Hector tries to kick at Ajax, but Ajax's thumbs dig deepe and deeper into Hector's throat. Hector's eyelids begin to flutter as he chokes. But the Salamisian king has lost too much blood. He sinks slowly to his knees. Hector is forced to his knees as well. Finally Ajax's eyes roll back.

Unlike the grassy field the men fought on yesterday, today's battle takes place on the sand, and sand is everywhere. Horse hooves kick up clouds of sand. Men struggle for footing in the loose sand. Red blood puddles on the yellow sand. But much more is different than the terrain. Now the Greeks have a leader. The Myrmidons are at the forefront, battling with a ferocity most Trojans have never seen before. A Trojan OFFICER, spear raised, gallops toward the figure of Achilles. Before the Trojan can throw, Eudorus hurls his spear, catching the officer in the neck. The man goes down. Odysseus, immersed in combat, sees this. He hesitates for a moment and in his distraction is nearly cut down by an axe-wielding Trojan. They fight. After Odysseus dispatches the man, he looks back toward the glittering figure of Achilles. Something's making him uneasy. A Trojan swings his sword at the shining warrior, narrowl missing a clean decapitation. The Greek hero thrusts his spear and guts the Trojan. The Myrmidons surge forward, hacking their way through th Trojans. The Greek army steadily pushes the Trojans back, picking up more and more momentum.
