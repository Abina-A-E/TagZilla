As we pull back further, we can't even see who the Lucky Bastard is because another AMAZING FEMALE is sitting on h face, MOANING and smoking a blunt. Just as we attempt to register what's going on -- We track another SPECTACULAR FEMALE in a two-piece bikini She grabs the blunt from her, hits it and walks out to th balcony. She blows out the smoke and passes it to one of HOMIES who's already rolling up more blunts from the poun weed sitting on the table in front of him. From there we crane down, passing the DJ rig on the secon floor balcony. Even the DJ has GIRLS around him, a blunt his mouth, and a drink in his hand. We crane down further to the bottom floor where MORE GIRL BIKINIS get sprayed by GUYS with SUPER SOAKERS and CHAMPA BOTTLES. It's an impromptu \"wet T-shirt\" contest. As we pull back across the pool, a few more TOPLESS GIRLS jump in and we realize we're at one of those famous Dr. Dre/Death Row pool parties. People everywhere. Sex in the air. Freezer-bags stuffed with high-grade weed are being passed out to everybody by Snoop Dogg himself. We catch a glimpse of two nice looking LADIES walking ove the bar. We will come to know one of them as NICOLE. But first-- IN THE GAZEBO, we find Dre smoking a blunt and playing DOMINOES with D.O.C., laughing, blowing off some much-nee steam. Until -- Dre's eyes settle on Nicole, who's different from the res She's not drunk, or dancing, or flirting. She's beautiful but in an understated way.
