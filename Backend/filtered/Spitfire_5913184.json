Morson rounds the corner gathering steamer  chairs--by this porthole he stops, transfixed  by what he accidentally glimpses through the  port-hole--he steps nearer, and gazes in  horror at Valda in room.

Valda rushes out of  door with wild excitement, but no outcry-- she knocks at various doors, groups come out, she notifies them.  Cut.",
