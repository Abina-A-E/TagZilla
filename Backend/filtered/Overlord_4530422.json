Boyce winces a bit. Covering the walls are RUNIC LETTERS and paintings of ANC TEUTONIC KNIGHTS. Swastikas too. And two crossed CEREMONI AXES, right out of the Middle Ages. In a glass cabinet are 500 VIALS OF BLACK BLOOD. One sits a GAS STOVE in a POT OF BOILING WATER. Boyce turns the st off. And hears a MACHINE-LIKE SOUND: A pump, sounds like it's on the other side of that CEILIN FLOOR CURTAIN. Boyce steps through it, rifle slung - and the OTHER HALF of this vast lab... It's a horror: FIFTEEN PEOPLE - \"SUBJECTS\" - barely human now, each of t TIED BY THEIR HANDS AND FEET TO HOSPITAL BEDS. They were villagers once. Now they look more like CREATUR Their flesh is black and blistered, everywhere - necrotid tissue bubbling on their arms, faces, necks, torsos. Thei eyes milky white, staring in a state of sustained torture On each bed Boyce finds a \"PATIENT FILE\" complete with BE AND AFTER PHOTOS - human decay, chronicled in German. Bes one of the beds, a 16 mm. CAMERA stands on a tripod... He drifts a bit closer, breathless. These people are bare alive, most of them unconscious, some of them vegetative; something is corroding them from the inside out: Connected to each villager is a machine of pumps and valv an AUTOJECTOR, pumping a thick black substance - looks li TAR - into each subject, circulating it mechanically. On BOTH ARMS of every subject are BLOOD DRAWS, feeding bl blood into bottles that sit on the floor. It's like a massive, gruesome dairy farm. But why??? Boyc drifts past each bed, shocked, speechless. Then, another shock - AUTOJECTOR #16 is connected by TUBE a_DISEMBODIED DOG'S-HEAD, which sits on a tray. \f63. Somehow, impossibly, the Autojector is keeping the head alive. Its MOUTH moves - just took in a breath. My God... Autojector #17 is hooked up to a HUMAN HEART, beating, suspended in air by STRINGS over the OPEN CHEST of Tibbet Tibbet's EYES have been removed. Holy Hell. Boyce shaken. Then, behind him, labored BREATHING. He turns, rifle slun In BED #3 is another villager/creature, suffering, tied u his body entirely BLISTERED and BLACK. His eyes crazed. B stares - something drawing him toward this creature, when A JUMP-SCARE - it BOLTS UP - still tied to the bed but lunging at Boyce with such force that the bed actually TOPPLES OVER, slamming on its side to the floor. That fas Boyce steps back, the Creature now pressed against the fl its breaths rattling. Boyce not sure what to do, as:",

Boyce saw it used last night. Ford crutche toward it. Boyce follows. The hose is coiled around a WHE Boyce starts to UNCOIL IT. It squeaks, LOUD. He stops. Scherzer, twenty feet away, doesn't turn - just staring i whatever is down there, obviously unsettled. Ford moves to the FAUCET - a red knob. He indicates to Bo \"When I turn this knob, you start RUNNING TO UNCOIL THE HOSE.\" Boyce nods. A moment, their eyes locked, then-- FORD TURNS THE RED KNOB - loud and squeaky. Scherzer turns at the sound-- Boyce starts running at him with the hose. Scherzer reaching for his RIFLE. Ford turning the knob harder - full blast. The hose UNCOILING off the wheel as fast as Boyce can run WATER EXPLODING OUT OF THE NOZZLE - too hard - the burst actually knocking Boyce off his feet.
