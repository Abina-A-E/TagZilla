Her eyes are black and shimmering with a strange dem light. He looks back to the road. Eyes dark and alive and floode with emotion beyond time. They have been brutally reborn a universe of sensual, unforgiving chaos and he can never turn back. WIDE. The car burns down the dirt road. The image transmogrifies into the SOFT FLICKERING ROTOSCO CELL ANIMATION of a DREAM. WIDER. From HIGH ABOVE we see his headlights cutting thro a winding forest. We pull back to reveal - WIDEST. A RANGE OF DARK ANCIENT MOUNTAINS. In the FORMATIONS of the rocks we can almost see the shap a WOMAN'S FACE. Her face. A thick bank of CLOUD and FOG rolls over the mountainscap like her hair blowing in the breeze one summer day.",
