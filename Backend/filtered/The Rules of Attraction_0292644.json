The Dutch all know English so I didn't h to speak any Dutch, which was a relief. Wanted to rent a but couldn't. The people I was staying with had bikes though, so I went biking one day and I saw a lot of cows geese and canals. I pulled off to the side of the road, g stoned and fell asleep, woke up, wrote a little, took som acid, made a few drawings, and then went to the red light district in Den Haag, because I heard the whores are clea and better looking than the whores in Amsterdam -- which were. I fucked one so hard that I skinned my knees. Ate lunch at a Burger King, which was better and no more expensive than the States. Stayed in the Amsterdam Youth Hostel where there were some cool German guys who spoke better English than I do. We bought some coke and I cruis the red light district until I found a brunette with big that reminds me of KJ. I gave her a hundred Guilders. She worked me up, mounted me, put on a good show, and in the she pulled me out and I came between her tits -- even tho I’m wearing a rubber. Afterward we made small talk about AIDS, her Moroccan pimp, and herself. I wake to the sound a wino singing. It is eight AM and hot as blazes. Had a beer and then headed South to Paris. Climbed the Eifel To with this Canadian guy named Tim for only seven Francs because the ticket machine was broke. Got the hang of the Subways. Told Tim to get lost. Met a French girl who’s going to Camden. I think she gave me mono. Went to Pamplo for the running of the bulls. Never saw one bull but I almost got trampled by the crowd. Dropped acid at the Mus Gala-Dali, which was a trip. Went to the lamest circus ev a goat and two guys on unicycles. Went to Nice and ate Mexican food at a place called Calexico -- or Mexicali. T went to Switzerland where I, ironically, couldn’t find an who had the time. Took the Glacier Express to Zermatt, th Matterhorn, and found out that I could ski it, which, whe you’re there, you have to do -- but I didn’t have gloves used socks instead and froze my hands. It was slushy but fun. Ate some Sourdough bread that tasted like it was mad with sour milk. Eurail Pass’d into Italy and accidently slept through Florence. Ended up in Rome which was big an hot and dirty. It was just like L.A., but with ruins. I went to the Vatican but couldn’t get in because I was wea shorts. I could get into the Sistine Chapel, which now th it’s been cleaned looked fake. At the train station I met two girls from Germany who I drank warm beer with. They’r living for a full year on only nine dollars a day. I teas them and then turn the couchette into a huge bed and we a fuck. I wake dirty and tired in Brindisi, which is hot an filthy.
