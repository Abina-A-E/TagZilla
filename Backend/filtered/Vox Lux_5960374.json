She recounted a story to Eleanor that went like this... Shortly after her classmate pulled the trigger and sent her to the place between life and death, a Place that she could only really ever describe to Eleanor as a “rush of color;” she had met the devil and made a deal with him in exchange for her life. He whispered her melodies and she returned with a mission to bring great change to the next century. BEAT. \f101. NARRATOR (CONT’D) He said, “shut your eyes and repeat after me.” CELESTE begins to shut her eyes... The NARRATOR speaks now at a very deliberate pace. NARRATOR (CONT’D) One for the money. Two for the show. On three we get ready. And on four - come with me. CELESTE’s expression conveys that though her spirit is exhausted at the peak of its achievement, it really has a been an achievement, nonetheless.",
