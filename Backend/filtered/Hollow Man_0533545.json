At the far end of the tube, we see a  gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the  frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind  it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to  pad down the tube s length. After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit  cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops. The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s  ears. The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a  door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle. The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING. The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on  the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and  dashes toward it. But an invisible force descends. The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body, crushing it. A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air,  halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes,  struggling against the unholy force. Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life  quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes... The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white  fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood. HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into  the rat.",
