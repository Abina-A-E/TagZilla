When she screams, Savage and Frank turn toward her. Both stop dead in their tracks. Staring at her. Taking her all in. Both enjoying what they see. Then it's back to the struggle. Savage has Frank bent over the sink. He's attempting to do him in with an electric toothbrush. CLOSEUP of Frank's struggle. The brush getting closer to his mouth. Then, as Frank struggles, the toothbrush glides over his teeth. Frank reacts as if this were pure torture. His mouth foaming up with toothpaste. Frank grabs a hair dryer. Turns it ON, blows hot air in Savage's face. Savage holds his face and screams. As Frank recovers from his brushing, Savage throws a towel at him, momentarily blinding Frank, while Savage runs out of the room. Frank, mouth billowing in toothpaste, goes after him.",

Frank and Savage end up on the ground with their heads: between the elevator doors, which keep jamming closed on their heads. The poodle yaps annoyingly at their heads. They both get up, a little woozy. Savage chokes Frank up against the wall with one hand and pulls a gun with the other. In desperation, Frank grabs a nearby fire hose, from a typical wall-mounted box. Frank manages to shove the hose nozzle into his attacker's mouth. Savage keeps up his attack. Frank turns on the water. Holds the nozzle in Savage's mouth. Savage immediately lets go of Frank. His cheeks bulging out with water. They look like two water balloons. Then his stomach begins to fill up. Frank sees the man has had enough. But he's shoved the hose too far down Savage's throat. He can't yank it out. Frank quickly goes to turn the water off. But the handle comes off in his hand, \"Oh, oh.\" Savage continues filling with water. (CONTINUED)",
