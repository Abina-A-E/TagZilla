Frank and Savage end up on the ground with their heads: between the elevator doors, which keep jamming closed on their heads. The poodle yaps annoyingly at their heads. They both get up, a little woozy. Savage chokes Frank up against the wall with one hand and pulls a gun with the other. In desperation, Frank grabs a nearby fire hose, from a typical wall-mounted box. Frank manages to shove the hose nozzle into his attacker's mouth. Savage keeps up his attack. Frank turns on the water. Holds the nozzle in Savage's mouth. Savage immediately lets go of Frank. His cheeks bulging out with water. They look like two water balloons. Then his stomach begins to fill up. Frank sees the man has had enough. But he's shoved the hose too far down Savage's throat. He can't yank it out. Frank quickly goes to turn the water off. But the handle comes off in his hand, \"Oh, oh.\" Savage continues filling with water. (CONTINUED)",
