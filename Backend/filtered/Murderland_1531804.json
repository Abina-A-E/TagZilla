There are even Dusk sky colors and clouds painted on the ceiling. SIMPSON is very confused.... He looks around him to see several multi colored buildings and he appears to be on a checkered red and white brick road between two rows of buildings. He sees a miniature castle at the end of the road that is about 1/50th scale of another similar theme park. The whole room is about 600 yards long and it gets small as you go near the castle. There is a Merry Go Round just to the left of castle and there are only four doors on the entire street. One labeled \"Movie Theater\", the second labeled \"The Old West\", the third \"Fantasy Land\" and the last labeled \"The Real World\". The ceiling is as high as a high school gymnasium.
