Inside the hearse, there are four somber men in black - a a coffin, of course, with a wreath of chrysanthemums on  top.   One of the men is driving, another is in the seat beside The other two are sitting in the rear of the hearse, flan the coffin.  All four seem fully aware of the solemnity o occasion. Now they hear a SIREN, faint at first, but rapidly growin louder.  The driver and the man next to him exchange a  nervous glance.  The other two men move tensely toward  the rear door of the hearse, raise the black curtain over glass panel, and peek out cautiously. Through the glass panel, they see a police car bearing do on them, the red light blinking, the SIREN screaming. The two men at the rear window gesture to the driver to  step on it.  He does. The hearse, obviously a souped-up job, instantly picks up speed, weaves crazily through traffic, the police car in pursuit.  The hearse careens around a corner at eighty  miles an hour, the police car right on its tail. By this time the policemen are leaning out of their car w drawn guns, firing at the hearse. The two men in the rear of the hearse, flattened against sides, pull a couple of sawed-off shotguns out of a hidde overhead rack.  Police bullets smash the glass panel and  whistle through the hearse.  The driver and the man next him duck, but the hearse continues at the same breakneck  speed.  The two men in back shove their guns through the  shattered glass, fire at the police car. Despite the hail of lead, the police car - its windshield cobwebbed with bullet holes - gains on the hearse. Suddenly the car skids out of control, jumps the curb,  comes to a screeching stop.  Policemen leap out, fire aft the hearse. In the speeding hearse, the last of the police bullets th into the coffin.  Instantly three geysers of liquid spurt through the bullet holes.  As the firing recedes, the two in the back put away their guns, remove the wreath from  the coffin, take the lid off.  The inside is jam-packed w bottles of booze, some of them shattered by the bullets. the men start to lift out the broken bottles - SUPERIMPOS",

There seem to be some rites going on inside, because a  number of mourners, singly and in couples, are hurrying  from the cold, windy street into Mozarella's parlor.

The drive honks the horn - one long and two short - as the other me step down and start to slide the coffin out.  The side do opens, and a dapper gent emerges.  He wears a tight-fitti black suit, a black fedora, and gray spats.  The spats ar very important.  He always wears spats.  His name is SPAT COLOMBO.  He cases the street, motions the men inside.  A they carry the coffin past him, he removes his fedora, ho it reverently over his heart.  Then he follows the men in head bowed. Across the street and around the corner, three police car draw up silently, and about fifteen uniformed policemen  and plain-clothes men spill out.  A Captain gives whisper orders, and the men scatter and discreetly take up positi around the funeral parlor. Out of one of the cars steps MULLIGAN, a tough Federal  Agent - in plain clothes, of course.  With him is a littl weasel of a man, shivering with cold and fear.

As Jerry and Joe proceed with dignity toward the front  door, we see Spats and his henchmen deployed in strategic positions around the lobby.  Jerry wheels Joe past Spats. Spats glances at them casually, then becomes aware of a  strange CLACKING SOUND.  He looks down. There is something decidedly odd about the bellhop -  because his trouser-legs terminate in high-heeled shoes. Spats, grinning smugly, signals the two henchmen who are  guarding the front door.  They start to close in on Joe a Jerry.  Jerry abruptly spins the wheel chair around, trun it toward the rear of the lobby.  The other to henchmen  take up the chase.  Jerry and Joe disappear into a corrid leading toward the rear of the hotel.  As the pursuing  henchmen start to turn into the corridor, the empty wheel chair comes whizzing toward them.

Dominating the room is a U-shaped table,  covered with flowers and about thirty place-settings, wit half grapefruit on each plate.  On the wall behind the he of the table is the banner welcoming the Friends of Itali Opera.  The boys glance around the empty room, make a  beeline for the main entrance.  As they reach the door, i starts to open, and voices are HEARD from the corridor.   They turn desperately toward a second door, but that too opening.  Trapped, they duck under the banquet table,  disappearing behind the long white tablecloth just as the banqueteers start to troop in.  They are the same mugs we saw in the lobby, but they are now dressed in tuxedos or  white dinner jackets.  Chatting amiably, they move to the places at the table. Under the table, Joe and Jerry huddle together as the  delegates start to seat themselves.  Suddenly a pair of l slide beneath the tablecloth directly in front of them - the boys recoil when they see that the owner's shoes are  encased in spats.
