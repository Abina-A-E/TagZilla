The Business. Traveler should bring only what fits in a carry-on bag. Checking your luggage is asking for trouble. The Packer carefully adds a clear plastic bag containing a variety of travel-size packets of detergent, shoe polish, antacid, shampoo, etc. MACON'S V.O. Add several travel-size packets of detergent so you won't fall into the hands of unfamiliar laundries. There are very few necessities in this world which do not come in travel-size packets. The Packer lays in a shaving kit. And on top of it a small format guidebook, well-thumbed and annotated, with a cover illustration of an armchair with wines. Above the drawing it reads THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST and below IN_THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. SOMETHING WIPES THE FRAME and we see that the Packer has laid a gray suit on the bed next to the overnight bag. Now, he reaches in and picks up the trousers. MACON'S V.O. One suit is plenty...if you take along travel-size packets of spot remover. The suit should be medium gray. Gray not only hides the dirt, but is handy for sudden funerals. The Packer takes us back to the overnight bag as he lays in a thick novel entitled MISS MACINTOSH, MY DARLING. MACON'S V.O. Always bring a book as protection against strangers. (MORE) (CONTINUED)",

He holds this last item a long time in his hands. It is a small, framed snapshot of a smiling young Boy. MACON'S V.O. And most importantly, never take along anything on your journey so valuable or dear...that its loss would devastate you. For the first time, we are CLOSE ON the face of the Packer.
