A handkerchief wiping tears from old black eyes in the audience. A glistening diamond ring is slipped by the masculine han onto a soft, feminine finger. Two pairs of moist lips meet in a passionate kiss. As the SONG ENDS, we’1ll WIDEN from the kiss to reveal handsome, sturdily-built, tuxedoed DAVE JOHNSON, probably embracing his gorgeous, not-much-younger bride, CLARICE C JOHNSON.

Share the work, share the wealth, for if one falls down, the other is there to pick him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one by his side. And in bed, two can warm each other at night. But one alone, shivers all night long. By yourself, you are unprotected. But with a partner you can face the worst the world has to offer. But even better is a cord of three strands because it is not easily broken.” (beat, closing his Bible) My brother, my sister... I’1l be honest with you. Life is gonna do its best to beat you up.
