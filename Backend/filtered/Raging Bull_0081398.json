Noon, midnight? and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, that would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing? Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, if this be nothing.\" -- That's from something called \"The Winter's Tale\" -- Shakespeare! You all remember Shakespeare. He wrote all them famous plays one after the other, then he went into a big slump and he ain't done anything good in years. That speech is about jealousy -- jealousy's a bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot of guys... take me... I almost killed my brother... I love him... he's my family... I mean, there's nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And that's the way we been goin' thru life -- doin' nothin' for each other! Anytime he got in trouble when we was kids, I got him out of it. You know, he used to steal little things when we was growin' up. But he was particular... only stole things that begin with an 'a' -- a watch, a car, a suit, a ring... But I was wrong... I shoulda never hit my brother. Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every time I need somethin' I gotta go shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist once told me, \"When you hit your brother you're really hittin' your mother, but you can't admit it to yourself.\" He's really crazy. I woulda never hit my mother. I mean, only in self-defense!",

I mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country. And if you're a guy like me, you ain't got a chance in a place like that. Especially if you're Italian... you come from the Bronx... and you're an ex-champ. As soon as they saw me... soon as they heard me... I know I'm in trouble. To me, they got an accent, and to them, I got an accent! You gotta get the picture -- I'm big, I got small hands, I walk like I'm still in the ring... the balls of my feet pop up and down, you know... and whenever I get the chance, I read a lot. So naturally, takin' all this into sideration, they figure it adds up to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I didn't mind too much when they called me \"Queer\" or \"Mr. Tough Guy\" or \"Yankee Punk\"... But one day these screws got to me... I was workin' on the work gang, pickin' up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin' and puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a sudden... one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree across my chest! This screw walks over, takin' his time, he looks down at me and says, \"Well, Champ Pimp... you lyin' down on the job again?\"! They got a great sense of humor when they're standin' there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest! So I look up at him and say, \"Oh, this tree... it fell on me.\" And he says, \"Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have known, I would've yelled 'timber'\" I said, \"Hey, look... it hurts. I think maybe I broke somethin'!\" He says, \"Well, whaddaya know... Champ PImp's got himself a boo-boo.\" Then I got as stupid as him. I said, \"If I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin' me the money you made last night?\"! Then another screw comes over and says, \"This Yankee creep givin' you trouble?\" -- What kind of trouble? What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with the tree? Now anybody else in their right mind would've said, \"No sir, I wouldn't think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble... I just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as I can.\" That's anybody else. When I said it... it was a little different. \"You stupid cracker... take your hands off me or I'll get up and kick your brains out -- but first you gotta bend over so I can find 'em!\" Next thing I know I'm in the hole. Solitary confinement. All my life I had guys in my corner yellin' \"Go get 'em, jake... kill 'em! You're the greatest.\" Now there's nobody rootin' for me. But it wasn't so bad. I learned things there. I learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall. I never knew how to do that before. Now I know. Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is two scratches. Wednesday is three scratches.
