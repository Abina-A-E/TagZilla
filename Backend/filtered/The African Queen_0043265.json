Some of t faces bear the marks of heavy savage ornaments which have been removed, or of tatooing and scarring rituals which h been outlived -- torn nostrils, lips and ear lobes, a nec curiously thin and weak from the enormously heavy metal b which used to surround it. Some of the children are naked near-naked. Nearly everybody dutifully shares open hymnal but it is obvious that few, if any, can read. The singing most of them is weirdly shy and inchoate -- a little like that of a neighborhood audience when a group \"sing\" is im upon them. But on certain high phrases a glad, rich, wet  soprano lifts out large and happy, very child-like; and a big male voice bleats forth joyous, jazz-like improvement on the tune, a little off-key. There are very few men pre We detail or bring into salience, bare feet slapping time and an anklet shimmying; a very earnest young married cou with the wedding ring prominent and an impressive phalanx children in tow; the owner of the happy soprano, a sweet, contented, pre-moral face; the owner of the big male voic the inevitable rather effeminate man in every congregatio who loves religion because he loves Beauty. He is immense pleased that he knows all the words (the others just dab them): he sings them without any knowledge of their meani they sound Hawaiian.

The singing is fraying out half to hell; the congregation a solid black wall of wandering eyes; a few pious convert frown or nudge at the less pious; a little group is coale toward the window. The hymn, meanwhile, continues: \"Feed me with the heavenly manna in this barren wildernes Be my sword, my shield, my banner, be the Lord my  righteousness.\" Rose's sense of artistic propriety is too much for her. T keep things going, she ought to play loud, but on the nex line -- \"When I tread the verge of Jordan...\" she shuts down to t vox humana and the tremolo and maintains that through -- \"Bid my anxious fears subside.\" On this line, Allnutt appears and lounges against the fro door frame still drawing on his cigar. Rose lets everythi rip fortissimo on the closing lines: \"Death of death, and hell's destruction land me safe on  Canaan's side.\" By the time of \"hell's destruction,\" Allnutt becomes awar that a lighted cigar in church is bad manners, and, noddi casual apology to Brother, tosses it away onto the packed dirt, out of our sight. Instantly there is a hell of a  hullaballoo o.s., all in gibberish, against which the clo words of the hymn compete stridently. The less self-controlled of the flock are no longer singi and are craning their necks and rolling their eyes, but w just enough Sunday-Schoolish discipline to stay in their  places. The more pious, with effort, keep their eyes wher they belong and SING all the harder. IN QUICK SHOTS, Brot and Rose redouble their efforts. There is a final long-dr \"Aaaa-men,\" and it is clear this is the closing hymn of t service. Brother closes his book and picks up his service book; Rose shuts and locks the box-organ and puts the key (which is on two shoestrings) around her neck.

Allnutt, licensed, takes a big bite of bread-and-butter and picks up his cup and washes it down. By Rose's covered reaction, it is cle that she has been taught never, never to do this, but tha she expects no better of such as Allnutt. Allnutt sighs w and contentedly. This, too, is bad manners to Rose, but s takes it in her stride. They go on soberly eating bread-and-butter and drinking t The only SOUNDS are those of china, sipping, chewing and  swallowing. Nobody looks at anyone else. Brother and Rose are wholly, stiffly reposeful; they are used to this. All begins to get a little squirmy, like a child in church. T silence makes him visibly uneasy, but he tries not to sho his uneasiness. All of a sudden, out of the silence, there is a SOUND lik mandolin string being plucked. At first the sound is  unidentifiable, though instantly all three glance sharply up, each at the other two, then away; in the next instant they recognize what it is and each glances sharply,  incredulously, at the other two -- and then again, quickl away; then Brother and Rose glance with full recognition Allnutt, at the instant that he knows the belly-growl is  his. At the moment of recognition, he glances down at his middle with a look of embarrassed reproach. He glances up quickly and slyly -- hopeful they've missed it -- to find the eyes of both still fixed on him. The instant their ey meet they bounce apart like billiard balls, and fix on th first neutral object they happen to hit. Then Allnutt loo at them again: neither will look at him. All three lift their cups at the same moment, for a cover disembarrassing drink of tea. Rose and Allnutt simultaneo recognize what they are doing (Brother is pretending to r misses it, and goes ahead and drinks his), and both, at t same moment, lower their cups to saucers with an almost  simultaneous clink. Both look away from each other. Broth clears his throat rather loudly and turns a page. Rose an Allnutt reach for their cups; Brother beats them to it. W Brother has again put down his cup, Rose -- the tail of h eye on Allnutt -- picks up her cup and drinks, her eyes  carefully empty above the cup. Allnutt has his cup again the way to his mouth when his insides give out with a gro so long-drawn and terrible that Rose first flinches, then makes a noise across it with her spoon, stirring her tea. Brother tightens up like a fist, his first reflex being t this loud one is a calculated piece of effrontery. Allnut just endures it, with a look of suffering stoicism. When is over there is a tense silence. Allnutt slowly, slyly l up at Brother; he is stone. He looks to Rose; she is gazi far off into space. Allnutt is quite embarrassed, and kno they are. He does his best to relieve his own embarrassme and theirs.",
