A good-looking man in his thirties.  To look at him, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong... The Hider walks with such strange grace that he could be on a conveyor belt, a variety of neighborhood houses passing him by, one style after another. Sunlight and shadow play over the Hider's face as he walk filtered through the lush trees and greenery all around. Then the hedge he's walking past ends and the next house makes him stop.  Because it isn't a house yet.  It's a half-house.  A house under reconstruction.  Part built, part torn down, part finished, part matchstick frame.  An evolving house, with a swarm of workmen all over it, hammering, sawing, drilling. The Hider stands and watches awhile.",

We SEE how the Hider spends his days -- in a library, studying diagrams in a book on Home Improvements. We SEE him in the house at night, up in the attic, workin on the floor in some way, hunched so we can't see.  He's draped a black cloth over the attic window and is surrounded by candles. We SEE the house taking shape.  Carpenters finishing a staircase. We SEE the Hider eating alone in a simple cafeteria. We SEE the back of the house at night.  The Hider appears over the edge of the roof, rappelling down on a rope, making little toeholds in the wall as he goes.  CHINK-CHI with a small hammer, the SOUND MUFFLED by cloth.  The hou is quite private from the view of its neighbors, and the section of wall the Hider has chosen for his secret ladde is further shadowed by being an indented corner. We SEE plumbers at work and painters arrive. We SEE the Hider cashing his disability insurance check a a check-cashing place. We SEE the house further along.  Painters painting. Electricians wiring.  Landscape gardeners planting. We SEE the Hider returning to the house at night, emergin out of shadows.  He goes to his special corner, looking around -- and starts climbing.  His hands and shoes findi the chinks in the wall only he knows are there.  In LONG SHOT, if we see the figure climbing fly-like up the side of the house at all, it's only because we know he's there We SEE locksmiths installing locks on doors.  Not that it will do any good now. We SEE the Hider drop silently to the ground at night. Newly planted vines help hide his descent even more and cause natural shadows to move on the side of the house in the breeze of the night.  The Hider walks down into the empty pool.  He stands in the middle of it.  There's a fu moon.  The Hider spreads his arms as if to float backward SPLASH!  We SEE the Hider backstroking off one end of a long swimming pool.  He rolls in the water and swims to t other end where he climbs out.  The Hider is strong and powerfully built.  He retrieves a towel from a bench.  Th towel says \"YMCA.\" We SEE the Hider at his YMCA locker, after having a showe Inside is everything he owns in the world.  The locker is packed with stuff. We SEE the house nearing completion.  Two men with clipboards walk around, checking final details. They go up to the attic.  Everything looks fine.  They go back down, closing the attic stairway door. We SEE the Hider at a booth in a coffee shop, sketching a diagram in a notebook while he eats. We SEE the house is done.  And here the MAIN TITLES PAUSE Because we are almost at the end of our set-up now.  Just one more important job to be taken care of.",

He ru his hand over its smooth surface, then suddenly leans forward to unscrew cables at the back.  This abrupt movement probably extends his life by a few minutes -- because when a hammer comes down on his head, the blow is only a glancing one. The Burglar groans and turns -- the Hider was thrown off- balance by his miss -- and the Burglar has enough time to put an arm up for protection -- the second blow shatterin his elbow.  He cries out in pain, but he's a strong man himself.  He's a match for the Hider!  He manages to grab the Hider's ankle at the same time and pull him completel off-balance -- the Hider throwing his arm out to stop himself falling, knocking to the floor the vase he bought for Julie -- landing on the floor himself as it SMASHES alongside him -- and with a great gasp the Burglar pushes the big television off the trolley onto the Hider. The Hider has the wind knocked out of him as the big TV lands heavily onto his chest, nearly squashing him like a bug.  The Burglar is already running away, clutching his broken elbow -- but the Hider's powerful arm shoots out t catch his leg, pulling the Burglar back, while with an almost superhuman effort the Hider heaves the TV off his chest. The Burglar struggles with all his might.  The two men wrestle on the living room floor.  The Burglar tries to gouge out the Hider's eyes.  Craning his face out of the reach of the Burglar's flailing, frenzied fingers, the Hider tries to get a firm grasp on him.  He grabs wildly at the Burglar's hair, finally getting a good hold.  He smashes the Burglar's head onto the glass-topped coffee table.  BANG, BANG, BANG -- the glass cracks -- BANG, BAN BANG, the Burglar's face into the glass until the glass breaks completely. The Burglar won't give up.  He's beyond pain.  He's only trying to survive.  His hand is at the Hider's throat, squeezing.  They throttle each ether.  The Burglar is on his back, his legs kicking at the Hider.  His shoe catche the Hider a kick to the ear.  They both cough and gasp as a release is forced, both struggling for a better positio the Burglar trying to slide out from under again, the Hid keeping him down -- and now the Hider is able to seize th Burglar's arm again and jam the fingers in a door jamb an pull the door back.  We don't hear the Burglar scream because the Hider's other hand is in his mouth, but the Burglar bites down so hard on it the Hider is the one who lets out a roar of animal agony and the Burglar's good ha punches at his face, the Burglar somehow on his feet agai trying to make it to the dining room. The Hider catches hold of the Burglar's shirt, tearing it but pulling the Burglar back to the floor -- and the Hider's foot slips in some blood and he lands hard on his back, hitting his head, the Burglar's torn shirt in his hand.  The Burglar is crawling on all fours to get away, but his knees slip in the blood, too, and the Hider's leg grapple him like a pair of pythons, pulling him back, and the two of them struggle on the slippery floor, out of breath, near exhaustion. There's a tall plant in the hall.  The Hider stuffs the Burglar's face in the pot, suffocating him in the soggy earth.  The Burglar's body twists and turns and kicks as he's smothered in the damp dirt, the tall plant shaking above the two of them, casting horrible shadows around th entrance hall in the moonlight cast from the skylight. The Hider can barely hold the Burglar's head in place, every muscle tensing as the Burglar's body shudders in rebellion -- and then the tremendous surge as the Burglar body breaks free!  -- Tall plant tipping as the Burglar pushes back against the Hider with unbelievable strength -- tall plant falling -- the Burglar knocking the Hider back flat on the floor, the Burglar on top, but the Hider still hugging him in a death grip, then getting a full-nelson hold on the Burglar's shoulders and neck, the two of them struggling to a standing position again, the Hider again smacking the Burglar's head again and again a again, into the front door this time, the Burglar sinking back to the floor, still resisting, still breathing, his good hand still madly feeling for a grip on the Hider, bu this time the Hider's hold is too strong and when he's go the Burglar on the floor again, he's able to get a knee into the small of the Burglar's back and with the knee as leverage and the full nelson on the Burglar's neck, the Hider pulls back with every last ounce of strength, pulling, pulling, moaning with the sheer effort of it unt -- the Burglar's neck BREAKS. The Hider rolls off, gasping for breath.  He pulls himsel to a sitting position against the front door.  He sits here in the entrance hall under the moonlit skylight with the shadows and the dead Burglar and the blood and the earth all over the floor and he breathes air into his lun as if he'll never get enough.",
