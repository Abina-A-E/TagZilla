They trail listlessly past him and continue on their way to the building's entrance.  Most of them carry or are using grey or black umbrellas.  Since they are coming from the parking lot, and since the entrance to the building is still almost a city block away once inside the fence, this straggling line of workers stretches hundreds of yards.  Some of the workers wear hats. We see the line of workers FROM HIGH OVERHEAD The line is in the same shape as the lightning bolt logo. One of these workers is JOE BANKS.  Joe is in his early thirties.  He's wearing a beat-up black trench coat; under the trench coat he's got on a cheap and square jacket and tie.  This is a depressed man.  You can see where he could be cool, where he could have something on the ball.  But he's way too beaten down and depressed to be cool.  Joe steps in a puddle.  He pulls his shoe out of the water.  He notices the sole is coming loose from the shoe.  This depresses him further.  He walks on.  The sound of the WATER SQUISHING in his shoe can be heard. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 1/15/89",

Joe passes by a sign on this fence that says \"Shipping.\" This area is filled with thousands of brown cardboard boxes; a shipping clerk among these boxes pulls a lever on a device; the device spews out several feet of wet brown tape.  Joe continues on.  He passes a sign on the fence that says \"Canteen.\"  This area contains a row of vending machines and two long tables; a guy who looks like he's going to die is sitting at one of the tables eating pink Hostess snowballs; he eats them in a slow, dismal way, as if they were giant sleeping pills.  Joe continues on.  He passes a sign on the fence that says \"Quality Control.\" This is the biggest area; it's filled with workers in shower caps and worn white jackets; they work a distance apart from each other, at long tables; they are inspecting terrifying medical instruments.  One of these workers, a middle-aged woman named Sally, attaches a catheter to an air pump.  The catheter inflates and finally explodes.  Sally seems satisfied.

He takes a sip of coffee and a bite of toast.  He 1ooks out the window.  The sun is just starting to come up. He looks at the coffee, at the little whiff of steam rising from the cracked cup.  The crack's in the shape of ACHI logo.  He looks at the toast with one bite missing and the butter melting into the golden bread.  He 1ooks at the sun's splendid red rim.  These things are so beautiful.  His eyes well up.  He takes another bite of the toast and another sip of the coffee and looks at the rising sun.  It's so great that he's here to experience these things, and so sad that he's leaving.  He goes back to the refrigerator and takes out the loaf of bread. He puts a couple of more slices in the toaster and the almost full loaf of bread next to the almost full pot of coffee.",

They both are holding deep sea fishing rods; they're trolling. MUSIC. \"The Girl From Ipanema,\" the famous recording by Getz and Gilberto, is playing now. Patricia reels in her line.  A beautiful fish is flapping on the end of it.  Joe reels in his line.  Nothing.  He watches as Patricia unhooks her catch and tosses it in a hamper.  Dagmar appears, looks in the hamper, and nods approvingly.  Then she looks at Joe.  Where's Joe's fish? Then he walks away again.  Joe casts again, while Patricia rebates her hook.  Then Patricia casts again. Mike arrives with a beer for Patricia, who accepts it. Mike leaves.  Patricia gets another strike, asks Joe to hold her beer, which he does.  She reels in another beautiful fish.  She unhooks it and throws it in the hamper.  Dagmar appears, looks in the hamper, nods approvingly, and then looks at Joe.  Where's Joe's fish? Joe looks at Dagmar, and then ignores her. Dagmar departs.  Joe goes back to fishing.  Now Joe gets a strike.  It's a big one!  The line goes burning out his reel.  Patricia notices.  She offers to help him.  He waves her off.  Dagmar appears.  She offers some advice. But Joe's completely focused on his rod.  The rod, which is substantial, starts to bend.  Mike comes back to watch.  The rod is almost bent double.  Then it goes madly to the left.  Offers of help are made, but Joe shouts them back.  Then the rod goes madly to the right. Dagmar runs OUT OF VIEW, and reappears with an enormous gaff, which she brandishes excitedly.  A sudden powerful tug almost pulls Joe off the back of the boat, but Mike grabs him just in time.  Joe is a man possessed.  He reels and pulls with superhuman determination.  Without warning, a huge head, the head of a hammerhead shark, appears at the stern.  Its eyes turn inboard and look at Joe.  Everybody drops everything and runs away. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 4/14/89",
