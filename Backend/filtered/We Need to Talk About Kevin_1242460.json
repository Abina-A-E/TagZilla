Eva rises slowly followed by Kevin. As she moves to hug him goodbye, he clings to her childis as he never had in childhood proper. He mutters something choked into the upturned collar of her coat...’I’m sorry’ She’s not sure if she’s heard him right but she takes the risk.",

Scrambling channels, news, talk shows, ads.... --.’an oldie but a goodie’ .---Are you lonesome tonight?... Do you miss me tonight? Neon signs reflected in the windscreen...Taco bell, Stapl Wallmart, swim over Eva's face... Does your memory stray to a bright sunny day. A church sign, a hand with a stop watch,’Lord teach me ho wait.’ \f142. She pulls up outside the duplex. Turns the engine off. Si in the car. Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? Later, inside. She sits on the couch dressed only in Franklin’s huge anc rock T-shirt. Absentmindedly, she pulls the material to h face.... breathes in. Her purse, half open sits waiting for her on the table, t box visible. A gulp of wine. She looks at the bottle, it’s down to the halfway mark. Fuck it, fills her glass. Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there? Eva, fuzzy...puts her hand out to grip the bannister. The is no bannister. A door at the end of the hall the opposite end to Eva's, room we haven’t seen before, a pause, she pushes the door open. Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again? A small, cell like bedroom; a neatly made, single bed. No much else, sparse and impersonal. She places the little box on a bare shelf, beside the onl book, ‘ROBIN HOOD’. Tell me dear are you.... She smooths down the bed covers, stands in the doorway fo moment. Lonesome tonight? Eva turns off the light leaving the empty room... waiting FADE TO BLACK. You know someone said that the world's a stage, and each must play a part... \f143. Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart... You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue... Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there, with emptiness all around... And if you wont come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down...",
