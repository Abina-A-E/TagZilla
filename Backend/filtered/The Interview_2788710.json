A PHOTO of JULES SITTING AT HER KITCHEN TABLE in front of laptop, surrounded by racks of clothes. JULES (cont'd) I started CTF in my kitchen eighteen months ago. It was just me, a model and a photographer, we were all women and we tried on everything we sold. (QUICK PHOTOS of all 3 trying on clothes, then sitting at computers) Then we described the fit to save you the hassle. We see WHAT THEY'VE TYPED: “Got boobs? This dress is for you!” “Snug fit but super-cool!” “This dress fits everyon We all just bought one!” JULES (cont'd) We called it human curation, then we mixed that with technology and four months later we were launched and now we have 250 people working with us here in Brooklyn and we’re still growing!",
