We  see, lying at the foot of the monkish figure, a  seminude figure of a woman whose back is sadly  lacerated. She is lying face down. In the monk's hand  is a knout or cat-o'-nine-tails, as though he had  been punishing her. In the background of this shot we see a workbench and  a work light. The vague figure of Igor is seen, at  work on a nearly completed bust. DOLLY UP TO A  CLOSE-UP of Igor's hands.
