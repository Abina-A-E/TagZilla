Wind blows the curling dust down the empty main street, past the picture show, a laundry, a dinky beauty parlor, a grocery store. A black Chevrolet pickup, vintage 1941, is coughing its way up the long road toward the square. ’S PI iP Cl CITY SQUAR: — DAWN 2 SONNY CRAWFORD riddles intently with the choke, trying to keep the pickup running. The radio is on but the sound of the motor all but drowms it out. In front of the picture show, the pickup dies and the popular 1951 song fills the cab. Sonny relaxes, yawns, peers at the movie posters a moment. (He wears a Levi jacket and his hair is neatly combed -- except for a cowlick at the back, which sticks straight up; now and then, he tries to smoot it down.) Before hitting the starter again, he blows into his hands. The pickup grinds for a minute, then kicks off -- Sonny races the engine before moving on. At the red light he looks over at Fanner, who is asleep in the front seat; his feet, in heavy brogans, are visible, propped on the dashboard, A pickup with three horses in it goes through the light. Sonny starts to turn toward the pool- hall, but far down the street sees a figure sweeping, and drives that way instead. BILLY is sweeping down the white line, toward the city limits sign, ribbons of dust around the broom. (He too wears a frayed Levi jacket -- also an old red baseball cap.) Sonny pulls up beside him and taps his horn. Billy looks up, grins happily, trots around and gets into the cab. Sonny makes a sweeping U-turn, reaches over and turns Billy’s cap around backwards. Billy grins. The song is over and an announcer comes on: COTTONSEED CLARK (v.o.) Folks, ol’ Cottonseed Clark talkin’ at you -- we’ll get some more good music out to you in a minute but first let me say a word or two about these wonderful Purina Poultry Chows...",

(He wears an old mackinaw and a pair of thoroughly run-down sheepskin house shoes. ) He winces at the inrush of cold wind, but gives the boys no more than a glance. As he bends to brush again he is seized with a coughing fit and has to stop brush- ing until the fit subsides, going behind the counter for his cough medicine. During Sam’s seizure, Billy picks up a piece of pool- chalk and ildy begins to lick it. Sonny gets himself a Peanut Pattie and a Dr. Pepper; puts a nickel on the counter and goes over to stand right in front of the old, open-burner gas stove to warm himself.
