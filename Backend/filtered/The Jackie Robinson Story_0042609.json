And just  like any other colored person with  sense enough to look around him and  understand what he sees, I know that  life in these United States can be  mighty tough for people who are a  little different from the majority --  in their skin, color or the way they  worship their God, or the way they  spell their names. I'm not fooled  because I've had a chance open to  very few Negro Americans. It's true  that I've been the laboratory specimen  in a great change in organized  baseball. I'm proud that I've made  good on my assignment to the point  where other colored players will  find it easier to enter the game and  go to the top. But I'm very well  aware that even this limited job  isn't finished. As I see it there  has been a terrific lot of  misunderstanding on this subject of  communism among Negroes in this  country, and it's bound to hurt my  people's cause unless it's cleared  up. I understand that there are some  few Negroes who are members of the  Communist party, and in event of war  with Russia they would probably act  just as any other Communists would.  So would members of other minority  and majority groups... Most Negroes --  and Italians and Irish and Jews and  Swedes and Slavs and other Americans --  would act just as all these groups  did in the last war. They'd do their  best to help their country stay out  of war; if unsuccessful, they'd do  their best to help their country win  the war -- against Russia or any  other enemy that threatened us... I  can't speak for any fifteen million  people any more than any other one  person can, but I know that I've got  too much invested for my wife and  child and myself in the future of  this country, and I and other  Americans of many races and faiths  have too much invested in our  country's welfare, for any of us to  throw it away. I am a religious man.  Therefore, I cherish America where I  am free to worship as I please, a  privilege which some countries do  not give. And I suspect that 999 out  of almost any 1,000 colored Americans  you meet will tell you the same thing.  But that doesn't mean that we're  going to stop fighting race  discrimination in this country until  we've got it licked. It means that  we're going to fight it all the harder  because our stake in the future is  so big. We can win our fight without  the Communists and we don't want  their help...",
