She spots a tunnel and heads for it, but before she can r it, the floor of bones gives way beneath her. The lower end of the LAIR is a drainage pool, stacked hig animal carcasses, thick with clotted blood and covered in much dust and debris it looks like a solid floor, but it’ 4 or 5 feet deep. SARAH plunges headfirst into this blood-pool, her torch f from her hand and landing on the far side. When SARAH surfaces again, all trace of her beauty and hu have vanished. She is covered in blood. After this Hellis baptism SARAH is now as frightening as anything else in t cave. She looks around, trying to spot the CRAWLER, but there i sign of it. She turns and heads for the tunnel, but almos immediately the CRAWLER bursts up out of the blood-pool i of her, bloody as Hell. It grabs her and the two of them disappear under the surf together. For a moment the surface of the pool goes calm....then th emerge, engaged in a_ ferocious battle, lashing out at ea other in savage fury. They have each other by the throat squeezing tightly. The CRAWLER is stronger and tries to f SARAH’s head under again. As she goes she reaches around her free hand, trying to find something, anything, she ca as a weapon. Just as her face disappears beneath the surface and blood into her gasping, open mouth, she grabs hold of a RIB BON thrusts its sharp broken tip into the CRAWLER’S eye. The CRAWLER wails and SARAH spits out blood, pushing the BONE deeper and deeper into the CRAWLER’S eye socket, for the CRAWLER underwater and keeping it there until it stop struggling. Exhausted, SARAH fights her way to the edge of the pool, with great effort hauls herself out onto the rim, where s collapses, face down, gasping in air. Then, just beyond her, we see something move. Another CRA has entered the LAIR. SARAH, looking toward us, becomes a its presence, and freezes still. She’s still covered in b much like everything else in the lair. \f145 146 80. She stays absolutely still as the CRAWLER, sniffing the a moves along the edge of the pool toward her. Then the CRAWLERS hand rests on SARAH’s head, as it sniff air, listening for signs of life.

The CRAWLER comes up close, sniffing the air before us, a behind it, we can see the crimson form of SARAH rising up slowly, menacingly like some savage goddess. SARAH takes a deep breath and lets it out, the CRAWLER sn the air, sensing the new smell, and turns back toward SAR as she brings the THIGH BONE crashing down on its skull, and again, her eyes blinded by blood and rage!

N side is about to go down without taking the other with it SARAH smashes her PICK into the side of her first attacke followed by a kick in the head from her heavy boot. But t leaves an opening for the other TwO to launch themselves driving her to the ground and knocking the FIREBRAND from grasp. JUNO and the FIRST CRAWLER are now pummelling away at eac in a pool red with blood from both of their wounds. Event JUNO sees an opening and smashes the CRAWLER across the j the PICK, shattering the handle and the creatures face - grabs its limp form and smashes the skull of her attacker repeatedly against the rock with her bare, bloody hands. SARAH swings her PICK, punching with her free hand and la out with her feet, kicking anything that gets in her way. now has TWO CRAWLERS on top of her and is fighting like a JUNO distracts ‘SCAR’ and they face off together, circlin other, leaving SARAH one on one. The two of them go at their attackers hammer and tongs, l into them with every ounce of strength they have left - T ferocity of their attack is more than a match for the CRA who rip and tear at the women's exposed skin. But the CRAWLER gets the advantage over SARAH and, strang her, holds her head under water. ‘SCAR’ lunges at JUNO and she ducks and rolls, grabbing t FLAMING BRAND and shoving it into the CRAWLER’S wide open ‘SCAR’ shrieks wildly as JUNO, still holding the FIREBRAN to her feet and stands over the hideous beast, bringing t point of her PICK downward, driving it into her nemesis’ At the same moment SARAH manages to grab a rock and smash into the creature’s head, crushing its skull. \f90. Finally it’s over. The two women stare at each other, and they no longer rec their former selves in the apparitions that now stand her filled with blood lust. They have become consumed by the darkness. Only now, after the fight, can we see that BETH’s WHISTLE hanging out of SARAH’S top. JUNO sees it and knows its significance. SARAH sees that Juno sees... The two of the eyes. JUNO eyes the WHISTLE nervously.",
