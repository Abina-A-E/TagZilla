It is more o push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. As Mick, se victory, charges, Haven knows he can't get to his feet in time, so he turns his body and springs at Mick's knees  shoulder first. The impact spills Mick on his face; befor he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own chest and palms turned out. His body crashes heavily, ang across Mick's head, and Haven's savagely pushing hands ma the other man's face into the hard ground. Then he rolls  clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. M gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. As h closes ponderously in on Haven, his booted foot suddenly  shoots out. Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the  blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that almost goes down. And now Mick gets to him. His great arm close around Haven's waist, his hands locked in the small Haven's back. Haven braces himself against the crushing  squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spin but there is nothing he can do against the implacable bru power of the other man. The sweat stands out on Haven's face as Mick's great stre bends him over farther and farther. He must do something, and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from of the ground. Mick, suddenly finding Haven's full weight pu him forward, crashes down on top of him. With all the str left in him, Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick's  stomach; as Mick's hold breaks, Haven rolls clear. Now they are both hurt. Haven's ribs and chest are so bru that it is agony to take a breath. He knows it has to end quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. As Mick t to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws  pile-driver punches to Mick's midsection; as Mick finally lowers his arms to cover his body, Haven shifts his attac to the face. This is not Mick's style of fighting, but as lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches Ha it is with punishing power. Toe to toe, they slug it out, the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick's fist, both groggy but both refusing to go down. Finally Mick is help to protect himself, but Haven hasn't got power left to kn him off those sturdy legs. Gathering himself, Haven hurls his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalcula glances off and falls flat on his face. As he rolls over, dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight staggered Mick; the big man has taken a step back, and no he starts to walk forward. Dazed and blind with pain, he  passes Haven, staggers forward until the tie-rail stops h There he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head f side to side like a wounded animal. The crowd is silent now, waiting. Haven gets to his feet, drunk with weariness. He puts a hand on Mick's shoulder, hasn't the strength to whirl him around. He braces himsel with one hand against the tie-rail, and almost in slow mo pulls Mick around and clips him one last time with his  remaining strength. Mick goes down.",
