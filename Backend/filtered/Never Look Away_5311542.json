By now we can see clearly that Kurt has accurately captured on the canvas Seeband’s pose. NEWS ANNOUNCER (V.O.

With great dexterity he tears the photo out of the paper, places the canvas sideways on the easel and pins the photo to it with two drawing pins. He picks up a stick of charcoal and copies the contour of the picture on to the canvas as an outline. And then he starts painting. He copies the photograph precisely. In black and white. Until the picture is finished and is identical to the photograph. And yet not completely identical.

With these pictures, which admittedly have genuine force in some mysterious’ way, Kurt Barnert seems on his way to becoming one of the leading artists of his generation - in painting, a supposedly long dead medium. But, like so many of his generation, he has no statement to make, no stories to tell, and nothing to say. He is rejecting artistic tradition, side- stepping the auto-biographical and is thus creating, perhaps for the first time in the history of art... a body of work in which the artist is almost irrelevant.

Through the windshield of the bus we see the driver pick up his radio and talk to the other drivers. Kurt takes up position in the center, the buses all around him. One of them hoots its horn, and then another. In the last 25 years the quality of bus horns has improved. A dozen buses are now hooting, creating a deep, dense, moving drone.
