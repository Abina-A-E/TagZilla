As WE PULL BACK, we can now make out that they are what seem like animated streaks of charcoal -- forming and reforming into a series of drawings: First, a small girl, clutching a rag doll.  She stares plaintively into the lens as around the edges of the frame, a male figure with a thick, black moustache, cradles her protectively in his arms. But this image quickly changes to a landscape -- evil and foreboding.  A desolate farmhouse against an overcast sky Leafless trees with spiky tentacles for branches sprout like eruptions from the very bowels of hell.  It's every shade of gray -- ominous, depraved. Now we start to close in on this landscape's heart of darkness -- a constricted old corn crib -- but before we get close enough to see inside it, the scene shifts.  A pale, sad-eyed teenage girl looking straight at us.  Then we move to a line drawing of the rag doll that the little girl had clutched earlier -- only now it hangs from a noose, surrounded by long, shattered lines that recall th farmhouse branches.  The last shift leads us to a dark haired little boy, scared into impenetrable silence, as h is approached from behind by the immense, leering presence of an adult male. Finally, this Rotoscope animated picture transform itself into reality -- an actual oil painting, wet and glistenin on a canvas.  It's the first image we've seen that has dimension or texture.  In a moment, a paint-stained hand enters the frame and feverishly smears the adult figure beyond all recognition with its fingers, leaving the little boy alone in the F.G.  Then, the hand leaves, returning with a paint brush.  It re-does the area surrounding the child in a wash of midnight blue.  As it does, we hear:",

There's a human life.  One that's been robbed of every chance at normalcy from the age of eight by vicious and relentless child abuse. Faust made a pact with the devil. Well, Billy Milligan made a pact, too.  But he did it to survive. Something inside his eight year old mind said \"I can't fight this man who adopts me, then rapes me.  Who tells me to call him Daddy, then buries me alive with just a metal pipe over my face for air.  And then urinates down the pipe.  I can't protect myself -- and neither can my mother.  And I'm too afraid to tell the police.  Or a teacher.  Because if I do, he'll kill me.  So I'll go to sleep.  And I'll let someone else take over my mind and my body to protect me.  And they can escape out of the ropes when he ties me up. And they can defend me.  And outsmart him.  And take the pain so I don't kill myself just to make it stop.\"  The only problem was, the personalities didn't conveniently go away when he grew up and no longer needed them.  They stayed.  And in order to fight fire with fire, some of those personalities had learned to be as angry and destructive as their tormentor.  And finally one of those personalities was a part of him who needed and demanded love. And her name was Adalana.  And three times, last October, in the woods outside Columbus, she took it.  By force.  The devil had finally come with the bill.  You've heard Dr. Caul and Dr. Harding both testify that Multiple Personality Disorder not only does exist, but that it's symptoms cannot be faked. Amnesiatic fugue states cannot be faked.  Nystagmus cannot be faked. And you've also heard them say that he's no longer a threat to himself or anybody else, but that if he's sent to Lima, where he will be given drugs instead of therapy, Billy will almost certainly re-fragment, and destroy all the remarkable progress he's made since coming to Athens. And although the prosecution has made a lot of the fact that Billy's doctors see it as essential to his recovery that he be allowed furloughs off of hospital grounds and into the city, there is a fundamental issue not being addressed here -- and that is the fact that Billy Milligan is not a criminal.  The court decided that when he was found not guilty.  And they were right to do so, We all like to think of ourselves as compassionate and caring human beings and yet as soon as that compassion threatens to demand something real from us -- a demonstration -- proof of its existence -- we draw the line. Please, your honor, let's use this opportunity to take one small step in narrowing the gap between our potential for compassion and the reality of its limits.  If I have an incurable disease, and I don't know it, and I give it to you, and you die -- can I to be tried as a murderer?  No.  I didn't know I was sick.  So you decide to quarantine me instead, which is only sensible, since we don't want me to hurt anyone else.  But, if I'm then cured to the point where I'm no longer contagious... do you never let me out again?  Billy Milligan has been fighting for his life since he was eight years old, your honor.  Now that he's finally got a piece of it back -- please don't take it away from him. GARY sits.",
