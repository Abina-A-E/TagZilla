Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness  grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of nightgown. As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips sligh while she fights to get away. Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab J ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to los her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the  doorway leading out of the room. Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the despe sound of a woman facing certain death. Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all othe sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud. Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford wal around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John s as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be som time yet before he comes to. Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over  Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the  doorway, sobbing hysterically.",
