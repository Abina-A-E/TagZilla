I could have  been a quadruple threat, kind of  like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer,  singer, actor, and I would possess  nuclear weapons, the latter being  the most threatening of the four. I  once sat on a bus and tried to will  myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended  up with was a sense of failure and a  mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth  and perhaps a grudging respect for  the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage.  For the most part I distrust dogs. I  slept in a horse once. It was quite  roomy. On second thought, it was the  Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss'  and my right testicle 'vinegar'.
