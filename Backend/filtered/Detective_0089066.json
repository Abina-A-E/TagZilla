Jude Mazzo adjusts his tailored suit, crosses underground structure. The first thing you notice is the walk. The Ju walk. Something between a stroll and a strut. The balls o his feet carry his weight effortlessly; his heels follow, scrapping the concrete in precise hypnotic rhythm. The wa of confidence. His walk presumes order in the space throu which it moves, creates an allusion of order if none exis It says: this space has purpose because I am passing thro it. This isn't the confidence of unthought arrogance. It's th considered arrogance of a leader. People want order; they crave it like bread or water. Those who create order are  avatars, above judgement or suspicion. Their walk, their  bearing, the echoing sound of their approaching footsteps are manna for the masses. * Mazzo unlocks his metallic navy blue 1987 Beretta, sits in. Stereo blasts \"Chantilly Lace,\" Big Bopper's 1959 roc hit, as he revs engine. Telephone RINGS from speakers. Th Big Bopper answers in ersatz negroid:",

Isn't it  significant to you that this  administration choose a man like me  at a time like this to direct so  sensitive an agency? Consider the  reasons they singled me out. Let's  glance at criminal acts and political  acts. The simple basic truth is there  is no distinction at all today --  they're alike, the activist and the  criminal. (passionate) Here's a rule and you better start  to memorize it! In every criminal  there is a subversive and in every  subversive there is a criminal! No  wonder we find terrorists so often  involved in crimes like kidnapping  and robbery. The difference between  those who rob banks and those  spreading terror is too small to be  taken into account. They have the  same objective, the criminal and the  terrorist, even though they use  different means: they want to overturn  our present social order, our way of  life! The Law shall prevail against  upheaval. The Law is permanent and  timeless, like sculpture, like a  temple. They call this \"The Age of  Terrorism\" -- and it's easy to see  why. Governments cower as their  leaders wheel and deal with criminals.  Nations are held hostage by thugs  and vandals. Cowardice is called  diplomacy. The Law is mocked. Justice  walks the streets like a whore. And  what do we do? We defenders of the  Law? We watch in disarray, play  politics, blame each other. (emphatic) No more. Remember this day.
