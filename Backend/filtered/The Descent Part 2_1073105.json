She lands her boots on the first crawlers head, slamming pick into the second huge crawler... Sarah faces Juno. No time to talk. A mother of a battle t fight. Whilst Rios climbs, Sarah and Juno hack at whatever comes them. Chopping. Cutting. Smashing...Side by side, Sarah a Juno slice, scythe, sever... A bloody blur of close-quarter combat, Sarah and Juno bar distinguishable from the Crawlers they fight. A Crawler lunges. Sinks its teeth into Sarah’s arm. Juno buries her pick into the Crawler’s back. The Crawler releases it jaws to SCREECH in agony, revealing its neck. Juno rams the axe right into the Crawler’s jugular Juno takes an excruciating claw-wound to her injured leg. Sarah jumps in, taking a heavy gut blow- crawler’s claws- that was meant for Juno. Back to back, Sarah and Juno dispatch the crawlers with a barrage of blows. ...Finally there are none left. Everything is dead. Juno and Sarah stand together at the centre of a bloody circle. Turning, they come face to face with one another. A bapti in blood. From all the tunnels, CLICKS, SCUTTLING... Juno picks up the thermal imaging camera. Every way she turns, down every tunnel, red spots: crawlers, closing in...HORDES OF THEM.",
