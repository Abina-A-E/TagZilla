The boy HEARS something. Turning off the music, he scuttles behind some bales of hay to hide. THE BARN DOOR creaks slowly open. Someone --we can’t see who -- enters...wearing LARGE BLAC BOOTS. He’s pushing a big container on wheels. Something’s inside the container -- we can’t see what... because it’s covered by a ratty old TARP. It’s pushed closer...its wheels SQUEAKING. HOLD on the BOY. In his hiding place. Worried. Very worried. The CONTAINER stops -- right in front of the bales of hay Inches from the BOY’s face. And then--- BLACK BOOTS throws back the tarp... revealing a tangled, intriguing CONTRAPTION of pipes and valves and funnels. The BOY -- peers through the bales of hay, not sure what the man doing.
