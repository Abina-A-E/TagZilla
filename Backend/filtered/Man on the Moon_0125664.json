ANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS. All are in black.  Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock. Andy's family is huddled. Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying. George gives Zmuda a hug.  Little Wendy comes over... and they comfort each other. Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays cast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger, Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on... And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions.  Th stare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.",
