You yourself spoke of \"bashing her head in\". Perhaps hoping you might discover the route for the proposed Sandford Bypass. You were already suspicious that Blower’s client George Merchant was buying up an area of land on the edge of the village, after a story Tim Messenger ran in the Citizen. You put two and two together after noting Merchant’s use of your car park to visit Blower who you knew all too well had an inside connection at the council.
