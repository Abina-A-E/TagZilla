On the lawn, a similar sized group of ARISTOCRATIC YOUNG WOMEN stand across from them. Behind is a tent and a tabl with the remains of an outdoor picnic. To one side of the women a young, beautiful and content GEORGIANA approaches with a hat. Inside are folded up pieces of paper which she mixes around. She offers the ha to the women and they each pick a piece of paper. One aft another they read out the names of the men opposite who look over and smile.
