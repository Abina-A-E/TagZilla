She sticks her hand into the drain... INSIDE THE DRAIN. The Declaration of Independence is stuc way down deep in the drain where the drain narrows. Abigail's hand reaches down for the tube, but it's...just out...of...reach. ON BEN and IAN. Bloodied, Ben hurls the broken sword at Ian who deflects it and charges Ben. Ben scrambles over the treasure pile, improvising, grabbi whatever he can to parry Ian's blows. A chalice...CLANK! An urn...which shatters! Ben grabs an alabaster cherubim. He holds it up to deflec a blow, but notices that it's just too beautiful to ruin. Ben sets it back down, then dives behind a PILLAR just as Ian swings again, striking the pillar instead...WHAM! Chu of marble fly. Ian circles around the pillar, chasing the wounded Ben wi his sword. Ian swings, and Ben ducks. This time, Ian's sword gets STUCK in the pillar. As Ian tries to extricate it... Ben pushes a Greek limestone statue. But it's heavy. It teeters...finally tips. Ian turns Aust in time to see the statue about to crush him. CRASH! But it doesn't crush Ian. The statue instead crashes into the pillar, leaving just enough space to save Ian. Ian grabs the sword, yanks it out... Bad idea. The pillar gives way, and the statue finishes its fall, smashing down on Ian. Killing him instantly. And tearing a hole in the stone wall behind him. Water GUSHES IN from the hole. It's the elevator shaft. As the water rushes in, the whole treasure chamber begins to rumble. Pieces of the stone ceiling start to fall, crashing down all around. Ben looks to see Abigail still struggling with the drain. \f362 363 364 National Treasure, 4/9/03 125.",
