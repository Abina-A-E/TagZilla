He then pulls out an ENVELOPE from his jacket pocket and places it on the nightstand. He looks at her one last time and ieaves. As he shuts the door, Melissa stirs. She turns over to find John gone and the envelope on the nightstand. Her peacefulness is quickly overtaken by sadness. She slowly reaches over and takes the envelope. \f1/9/03 . 67. She opens it warily, and pulls out a VELVET POUCH. Curious, she reaches in and pulls out a HUGE ENGAGEMENT RING. She grasps it tightly, relieved and ecstatic. She lays back down - a smile spreading across her face. INT. PAUL‘S HOUSE - NIGHT A view from outside Paul’s big bay window. Inside we can see the group gathered - Paul, Catter, Rob and Mollie - all sitting in the kitchen, eating dinner. Paul’s continually up and down, filling people’s glasses with wine. They’re having fun but the group seems - small. INT. WES’ (& TORY’ s) APARTMENT - NIGHT Wes and Toby are in the living room - she’s packing up boxes, he’s laying on the couch watching TV. She plops on the floor and starts watching too. ON TV - they’re watching the video from their rehearsal _ dinner. The still picture montage - their lives up until this point. Wes and Toby watch this, together. Not happy, not sad, just ready for what’s to come. FADE OUT.",
