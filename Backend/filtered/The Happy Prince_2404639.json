DAY 58 CYRIL and VIVIAN listen by the door to the conversation inside. CONSTANCE V.O. I feel sure that if I saw him once, I should forgive him everything. MR. HOWARD V.O. Precisely, my dear, and then you would be stuck here in Heidelberg forever. Heidelberg! CONSTANCE V.O. We like it. MR HOWARD V.O. You must wait! Think of your children. He must prove to you that he will change. That he can. You have time. Don’t hurry. CONSTANCE V.O. Very well I will do as you both suggest. I will harden my heart for the sake of the boys. 3/11/16 \f59 60 61 31 INT. CONSTANCE’S SITTING ROOM. DAY. 59 CONSTANCE sits down and begins to write a letter. She loo out of the window.
