I follow and, res on a bench in the middle of the clutter, there it is. Pinky's wheelchair. Hanging upside-down, over the edge of workbench. Engine HUMMING, wheels SPINNING. Odd, but of n use to me.

His wheels spin, sending him into a bizarre wheelie. I ju to my feet, search for something to use in self-defense. I decide on the CHAINSAW over there. I yank the chain and ROARS to life. Pinky’s heard the chainsaw, and ceased his manic destruction of the room. Now he idles front and center, staring me down. I REV the chainsaw. In response, Pinky forces his jaws very wide apart -- the CHOMPS down, sending the pipe through his upper jaw and r out the top of its snout. He charges. The chainsaw, though ferocious, is unwieldy, hard to hand in close quarters combat. Pinky butts me, knocks me back. swipe at him, SAW in half the pipe protruding from his fa Pinky ROARS, SNAPS at my legs. I strafe left, tear a mass gash in Pinky’s muscular shoulder. He SCREAMS, leaps at m His front legs catch me in the chest before I can bring t chainsaw back up, and I crash to the ground. Pinky bounds off, smart enough to stay moving. I get to m feet before he BUTTS me again. My chainsaw skitters away. Pinky TEARS away a portion of my calf. Breathing hard, I grab a sledgehammer and CRACK his skull, send him tumblin \f91. I stand and, knowing this is my last chance, make a dash the still-running chainsaw. I scoop it up with one hand a spin at the same time, just as Pinky hurtles toward me. I swipe at him in mid-air, connect -- and send Pinky plummeting, along with the chainsaw, to the ground. Pinky rights himself, sets his feet, and...can’t move. He looks around, confused.

John looks to Sarge, then to Sam, who has pulled herself her feet. Back to Sarge, then...he RUSHES for Sam. Sarge HOWLS, takes off after him. In one motion, John GRABS Sam by the hand, forcibly tucks pistol into her waistband, and IRISH WHIPS her into the opened elevator. She THUDS against the back wall, loses h air. John SMACKS the “up” button on the lift shaft, then YANKS both keys from their slots so that the command cannot be halted. The lift starts rising even before the doors clos fully, and John uses this last window to look his sister the eyes. JOHN (cont'd) If I’m not the one who comes out at the top...shoot him. Sam nods, then SCREAMS as Sarge HURTLES into John from behind, BELLOWING. He SWATS at John, catching him upside head and sending him sprawling. In a desperate last attempt, Sarge THRUSTS his hand betwe the closing doors. The doors grind to a halt, partially smashing Sarge’s arm. He HOWLS, paws at the doors. He manages to get his other hand in between the doors, an with superhuman strength PRIES THE DOORS OPEN. He holds t open just long enough for John to BODY TACKLE him through doors, which SLAM shut behind them. The two are now sealed in the empty elevator shaft, with floor of the lift car slowly rising upward above them. Sa leaps back to his feet and BELLOWS. He punishes John with pile-driver blows. John absorbs the hurting as any man would -- but bouncing back unlike any could. He grabs Sarge’s neck, pulls his head back and... CRUNCH! Slams his forehead into Sarge’s face. A sickening sound as Sarge’s frontal bone is smashed inward, thrustin his brow into his forehead. Sarge howls, but John is relentless. He pummels Sarge. John only falters -- surprised -- when he HEARS: \f96.",
