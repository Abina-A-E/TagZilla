I know that a terrifying story like that coming from the mouth of a4 recognized authority figure is traumatizing because I had a similar experience with my Uncle Roy and a story ke told abouc a family that went to the woods and was attacked by a band of escaped Army psychiatric patients who'd been subjected to vicious, violent, hellish behavior modification experiments. They escaped the metal boxes that they lived in and went off into the woods and slaughtered and ate this family before they were recaptured. Now, that story gave me nightmares not to be believed and I don't want Uncle Chec's bear story to upset you in the same way. So I'm here to say there isn't a bear like that, none of what Uncle Chet said actually happened and that even if there were a bear out there, I'm in the house prepared to protect you. I love you and nothing will happen to you. At the absolute worst, and I'm not saying this'll happen but in a worst case sceanerio, maybe a bear gets in the house but believe me, he'll go for the cookies and sweets before he goes for you and anyone else So, wa're ast 2 to th ot anything else unpleasant, We're go close our eyes and dream about nice things.
