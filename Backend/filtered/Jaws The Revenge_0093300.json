Hardly more than a shadow, his face just barely illuminated by the occasional dull r light, Sean gathers the towline and begins trying to secu it to the piling, a difficult job in the cold, which requires him to lean out over the side as far as he can. The band is heard starting up on the dock, gradually col- lecting itself until it sounds like one, playing \"The Fir Noel.\"  A few moments later, the choir begins singing it. Suddenly the water explodes up around him violently and t boat rocks in the shock of it and a dark form is seen, fo an instant, and Sean disappears from our view.  The boat' spotlight rocks crazily.  Then the turmoil of the water d and all is calm and the singing from the dock is heard clearly again. Sean, holding onto his shredded sleeve and coat, bleeding profusely, has fallen  to a corner of the stern.  He look off toward the dock and opens his mouth to call for help, but nothing comes out.  The music grows louder as the ban and chorus find their confidence. Then a tremendous surge of water explodes upward and the dark form is seen again, for an instant, and our view of Sean is lost.  When we can see again, Sean and a corner of the stern are gone. For a moment, Sean is seen holding onto the piece of dock piling with his remaining arm.  He cries out for help but it's lost in the swelling sound of the Christmas Carol coming from the dock.  Then Sean and the pole disappear beneath the surface.  He's just gone.  A few moments late the pole pops back to the surface.  In the rocking spotlight from the boat, the clear outline of the shark's jaws can be seen where it's taken a chunk of it.
