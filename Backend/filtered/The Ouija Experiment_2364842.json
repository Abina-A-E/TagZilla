And Laine finally finds the exact same photo of her and Debbie on the floor playing the Ouija. Laine holds up the printed photo next to the image on her screen. There's no glare on her computer version. The one from Debbie's bulletin board is definitely different. CLOSE ON THE PRINTED PHOTO. Suddenly lit up with a bright FLASH OF LIGHT. Laine takes a ‘snapscan’ of the photo with her iPad. She opens up the image in her photo app and ENLARGES THE PICT She scrolls around. Down to the Ouija board. That WEIRD GLARE. Laine taps -- blows the photo up even more. The glare seems to perfectly highlight the word GOOD BYE at t bottom of the Ouija board. Off of Laine’s puzzled expression cut to -- EXT.
