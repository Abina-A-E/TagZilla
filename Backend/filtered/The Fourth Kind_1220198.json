Asked. if he believ- ed Dr, Tyler was.guilty, he stopp- éd short of saying she was innoce- nt, “There's #6 motive, no evide- “nce, ahd no girl. On paper there's no reason she should have kidnap- ped her own daughter. But she’s nat here, and we have no idea w- here the hell she is.” Reports speculate that Ashley's | disappearance could be related to; the hundreds of people who have disappeared in the city, which has cases going back to 1960 and occ- urting as recently as last month. Most of Nome’s missing person cases have gone unsolved, as have most missing person cases throug- hout Alaska due to the severity of the land.",
