From sunny to shade. Walks past the chain-link fence.  The padlocked gate, big enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked withi the compound. Walks past the closed security door which would appear to the building's main entrance. Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door a well. Comes around this block again.

Wils nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.  On the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.  Snaps wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.  Wire cutters. He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might ha thought.  He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where fence meets the adjoining building.  SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SN SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll under.
