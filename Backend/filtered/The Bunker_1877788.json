As he feels Rolland stagger, Abel puts every last ounce of strength he has left to get him onto the ground. Rolland hits the floor with a loud crack as his skull bounces on the floor. Abel, as nimble as a cat, does not waste a second, and lands punch after punch into his face. Erik holds Rolland's feet as Jami grabs her stake which Rolland discarded. This time her aim is true as she drives the stake clean through his evil heart. Rolland goes limp and quiet for a brief moment, starts to choke and goes into seizure. Jami and Erik back way the hell off. Abel stands over him, he watches him twitch and shake with cold angry eyes. Abel raises a massive boot and stamps the stake all the way home!
