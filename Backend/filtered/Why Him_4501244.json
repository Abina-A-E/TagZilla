I tell him I’1l1 come back another time, but he says, “No, come in. Sit down. Have a drink with me.” So I do. We get a couple of drinks in just chatting about the weather and so on and I finally get the courage to ask him. How did Brahms, the real Brahms die? He looks at me. Kind of shakes his head as if even he doesn’t know anymore. And he says, “Can a boy die of shyness?” And I tell him, “I suppose he could.” “Then that’s what it was,” he says. And then he excused himself and said he’d better get to the birthday party or he was going to catch hell from the missus.
