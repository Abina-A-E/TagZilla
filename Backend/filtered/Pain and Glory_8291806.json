Mercedes is about 50, she has spent half her life at Salvador’s side, as his assistant in everything. Even though he no longer works, they keep in touch. Mercedes is the closest thing to a family that Salvador has. Efficient, warm, loyal, special, intelligent and not at all intrusive. There are no secrets between them or, if there are, they are minimal and the result of respect. Mercedes and Salvador walk sadly through the park in which the cat’s remains now rest.",

We discover Salvador totally submerged in the water and completely motionless, his knees slightly bent and his arms outstretched, as if supported by invisible armrests. (Underwater shot.) Weightlessness keeps him in this posture. He just has to control his breathing. It’s the most similar sensation to being bodiless. His head slowly emerges, only as far as his neck, the rest of his body remains motionless in the same posture. He keeps his eyes closed, he breathes steadily. His head submerges again. In this position his body doesn’t suffer any muscular’ tension. Neck, back shoulders, knees, the lumbar region, all stiffness disappears. As he doesn’t feel his body, his mind, volatile, is like an open window through which the light and the evening breeze enter. Undoubtedly, the most pleasant sensation of the day.",

Jacinta smiles back at the child as she sings. The soap, made at home from fat left over from cooking, doesn’t produce foam but it leaves (non-contaminating) lumps on the surface of the water.

It’s an image full of life and cheerfulness. This is one of the few memories that Salvador will have of his mother cheerful and singing. At the age of three, Salvador doesn’t realize that this will be one of the happiest moments in his life.

He doesn’t hesitate for a second before diving into the document. And rummaging in it. 38. SALVADOR’S HOUSE. OFFICE. INT. NIGHT.

Mercedes is among them, excited and moved by the screening and by _ the audience’s reaction. She looks at her watch uneasily. With the lights still out, in the area nearest the stage, the director of the Cinematheque is murmuring with two employees who are asking him something. This must be seen from Mercedes’ point of view: the director tells them to put three chairs in front of the seats on the main floor, on a little dais on which there is only the microphone on a stand with which he presented the film. Mercedes, curious, watches them from her seat. The director, looking worried, walks along the central aisle to the door of the screening room, separated by red curtains. The stage curtains are a bluish grey. The director looks nervous, he has his cell phone in his hand, like a appendix of himself. He stops by the red curtains. Mercedes goes up to him, they obviously know each other.

The two threaten each other verbally but we can’t understand what they’re saying. One shouts “NO” all the time. The man with the machete forces his opponent to back away. Both rip the air with blows that are easily \favoided. A friend tries to separate them but finally gives up. The man with the machete cuts the other on the leg. It mustn’t be very deep because he stays on his feet and keeps attacking the heavily built man. Among those watching the duel there is a group of four, with haircuts and clothes similar to that of the duelists. They end up getting between the two. And rather than convincing them, it seems that the duelists have got bored with the fight. The one with the machete puts the weapon in its sheath and goes off in the opposite direction to the other, wounded in the leg, but still on his feet and leaving a trail of blood on the ground. A police car drives up. Salvador has seen everything from a prudent distance. A neighbor films the duel from his balcony. Salvador is leaving when the capturer appears. He calls him.

He hesitates, he thinks about what he’s doing. He thinks better of it and ends up blowing the line away, its contents hang in the air for an instant and disintegrate before they reach the floor.
