Joey can't hear what's being said on the other side of the glass, but the essence of the scene is apparent. Copying an amazingly complex mathematical question from a small sheet of paper she holds, the Professor 1s writing it onto a blackboard. There appear to be more symbols than numbers. Even the majority of us, who will have no idea of what it is that she's writing, will understand that to comprehend such a question takes a real measure of brilliance. Mary merely watches, quietly watches. Finally finished, the Professor hands the stick of chalk to Mary, gives her some brief, last-minute instructions, then checks the time on her watch as she walks away, heading toward one of the computers. Joey stares at Mary, staring at the mass of symbols and numbers on the blackboard. The Professor sits down at a@ computer, the small sheet of paper beside her, ready to enter the same question. She raises her hands to begin typing, but suddenly stops. A SOUND has distracted her. She looks up. Joey looks. Mary is writing the answer to the question, writing steadily, in large and clear numbers and symbols on the blackboard. Professor Hobbs stares in speechless awe. Joey begins to grin. Mary continues to write. The Professor slowly stands. Joey's grin widens. Mary draws a line under her work, puts the chalk in the rack, turns toward the Professor -- without even the smallest trace of superiority in her expression. The Professor, staggered by this display of genius, feels suddenly weak in the kmees and slumps back onto her chair. Mary turns to look through the glass wall at Joey. He raises a thumb. :",
