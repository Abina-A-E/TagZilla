The bandstand just out of sight... Comes round the bend and sees Junior on the bandstand - M is stopped in his tracks, the quintet is great, but he's truly captivated by the virtuosity of Junior. Dave is blo away by the kid, goes to comment to Miles, stops, seeing differently now, ‘Miles appreciating greatness’, somethin new. The band is having a good time, laughing as one or anothe calls out rapid chord changes - trying to one up each oth as the players have to catch on/up to the changes - but n Junior - he's right there, a monster, not only keeps up, anchors the band, bringing the music back around on the s like Kelly Slater killing it on the wave of a Tsunami - .",
