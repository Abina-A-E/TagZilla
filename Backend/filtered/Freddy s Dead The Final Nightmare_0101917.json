She couldn't talk to another man without  him thinking she wanted to go to bed with  him.  He never hit me. But the things he  did to her...and she would always just  take it.  She never fought back.  He'd  get drunk and...she'd tell people she  just fell down or something.  Then one  night...I was thirteen.  Something  happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take  it anymore.  Something made her say  enough is enough.  She hit back.  Tat  only made it worse.  I watched as he hit  her over and over.  Then he knocked her  down the stairs.  She broke her neck.   And when y father saw what he'd done - he  finally became human.  He cried over her  body for a while, then went into the  garage and blew his brains out with a  shotgun.  To this day I don't remember  what that final straw was.  The shrinks  say I've blocked it out of my memory.   There's no one else alive who knows what  really happened.

It's as if people moved in and out and instead changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a n one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox. The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches i with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away. name underneath makes Karen gasp. It reads KRUEGER. And there's still another one under that horrible name.   Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.  The last sign  reads UNDERWOOD. Karen frowns.  She turns back to the house, a determined  expression on her face. KAREN",

Power Cop runs up, grabs Karen and yells. POWER COP",
