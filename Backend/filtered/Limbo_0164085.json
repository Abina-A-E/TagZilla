I was putting his rifle back where he hid it in the shed roof when I heard him cry out. He wouldn't let me in at first, though I hollered and struck at the door. He opened up when he'd got her down on the table, but I saw the black mark around her neck where the cord was. The fire had gone out, so our breath was showing, Papa and me, and it was like long white sighs of grief in the room and her mouth open and hair crispy to the touch. We wrapped her in the afghan, then I got the fire going while Papa just sat. Nothing to say. Later we found the note and she told how the animals were Satan's handmaidens, how their sharp little eyes would not give her peace so she killed them and threw the axe in the woods. 'We have looked into ourselves,' she wrote, ‘and what is there condemns us.' We'll take her off the island come first thaw.
