He’s returned, hands Javier the beer. He sits back down. MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D) My father decides he wants an “Italian” wife. An “Italian” family. So he disallows Spanish in his home. He cuts off contact with her family. Mama has nothing to care about. No one to love. And so... she gets pregnant. With me. As I get older, we make a pact: she will teach me Spanish, she will teach me about that half of my heritage - but my father must never know. And over those years -— whenever my father travels for work - she secretly arranges for packages to be shipped from her homeland. Spanish foods and wines and treats - we would eat them so fast our stomach would swell, Javier! Always making sure we never left a trace that my father might discover. Our favorite treat was always the Spanish olive oil. Can you imagine, Javier!? There we are in the Italian countryside - home to the richest olive oil in the world - pouring Spanish olive oil down our throats like you and I now drink this cervesa. What a pair Mama and I were. What a pair indeed. Mr. Saccione sips his beer. MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D) She died, my mother. When I was just sixteen. As soon as she died, that royal fuck of a man cut me off. I lived in squalor through my teens and twenties. He saw my mother in me, Javier. And in my mother he saw only a dirty Spaniard who had ruined his life. \f67. A beat. Slowly, Mr. Saccione smiles. MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D) Luckily for me: my father wasn’t just a bigot, he was also a narcissist. He never thought he would die, even as he got older, even as he got sicker. And so... he never made a will. (then) The moment that royal fuck of a man left this earth, I became a wildly wealthy man, Javier. And the first thing I did was buy this land back in Andulucia, where I now grow hundreds of acres of the olive oil that Mama and I once hoarded. And while business keeps me away most of the time, this land is the only thing that matters to me, Javier. This land is my story, and it is my mama’s story. It is everything to me. This hangs there. Mr. Saccione finishes off his beer. MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D) And so, Javier: that is why the olives mean so much to me. And now I must ask you: why do they mean so much to you?",
