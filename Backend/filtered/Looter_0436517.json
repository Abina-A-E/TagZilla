INTERCUT with the police marshalling their forces for the final showdown. \fLootera Shooting Draft vl Pg 108 Varun walks around the house and from behind the pile of wood, he removes a wooden ladder. He carries it towards the tree. Snow begins to fall harder. Varun places the ladder against the tree trunk and slowly climbs up the tree, till he reaches a branch. He takes the painted leaf, and some string. We see other, older pieces of string on the tree. Varun starts to tie the painted leaf around the branch of the tree. The snow falls harder, the wind gets stronger. The leaf flutters and flies off. Varun reaches his hand out and grabs the leaf. The ladder falls away. He hangs onto the brach with one hand, slamming into the tree trun He wants to shout out in pain, but can't. Blood falls on the snow. The police gather at the end of the lane, led by KN Singh With a mighty pull, Varun climbs onto the trunk of the tree and reaches further onto the branch. He reaches further onto the branch. The wood digs into his side. He grimaces in pain but doesn't stop. Blood seeps all the way out to his jacket. He ties the leaf around the branch with his last bit of strength, then lets go. He falls to the ground, hitting the snow, injuring himsel even more. The wind swirls, the snow falls. But the leaf hangs on. Varun gets up looks at the tree, then notices a very weak and watery sun on the horizon, the first time we've seen it in a while. He smiles and starts walking out of the gate. He walks on the forest path, bent over in pain. He looks up, and sees the police at the end of the lane, guns pointing towards him. He keeps walking, looking them in the eye. Then takes out the gun he has, holds it in his hand. KN Singh taps a policeman on the shoulder. He fires. Varun takes a bullet in the chest. Slumps to his knees.
