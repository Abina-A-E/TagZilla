In a flash, Nico swings the machete, slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain link fence, out of reach.

Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc, blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in pain. D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow, flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail- ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with just his head and shoulders dangling free. E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four, and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu- tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third, machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re- mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at his own groin. F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des- perately to regain his senses. He tries to get Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a- way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror, bolts. G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van window.
