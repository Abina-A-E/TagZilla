My vision moves in very close to this marvelous young milk-laden breast.* I stop in front of this reassuring image for a long time. The baby's face shows a feeling of happiness mounting to bliss. A girl (OS) - Aren't you a happy little thing, suckling your mommy? A girl's hand strokes the baby's head. A girl (OS) - What's his name? Moira - His name is Oscar. Moira is sitting with ner baby in Tito's loft. Nelly and friend of hers are leaning over the baby, coochy-cooing i tenderly. The baby gurgles. They are lit by a very bright a light bulb. In the loft behind them, another girl friend of Nelly's, fresh-faced and pretty as the first, is being chatted up the ever-nice Bruno. A few words of their conversation drift over to me, of which: \"it's a cosmic orgasm...\". Th young girl laughs. Tito is there too. He turns the radio up. We hear a very cheerful song from the 70's, remixed with a thudding techno beat. Then Tito examines two books siting on the table next to him: the omnipresent book with the mandala on the cover and \"The first three minutes of the universe\". He finally picks up the latter and goes to sit on his bed to flick through it. On the wall above him, a calendar in psychedelic letters shows the year we are in: 2001. * Director's note: From this scene on, Oscar's visions no any \"out of body\" or subjective vision logic and their ci closr to flashback form, but much more freely cut up. The visions of a future life, a kind of ultimate projection o are unstable, blurred and bathed at the edges by a yellow Normal colors only feature in the center of the image.

Nelly comes out to join Moira on the balcony and takes the baby in her arms. Moira straightens her golden yellow dress and looks at the sky. Nelly - So it's over with Mario? Moira - Yes, | think so... I can't stand him any more. Nelly is silent for a moment, then adds: Nelly - You can stay here as long as you like. Moira laughs and kisses Nelly on the lips. A distant noise approaches: a small gray plane flying across the sky. The same one Moira and I saw the day I died... Moira (to the baby) - Look Oscar... there's an airplane up in the sky... The plane rises higher and higher and disappears behind the clouds. Through a chink in the clouds we catch a glimpse of a vast distant space, bathed in golden light. Then the chin closes and other fleeting images of a future life are superimposed onto the clouds. We vaguely make out a child age 8, then a teenager... But the images flash up too fast. . Just one image seems to linger: a teenager making love with a girl in an ultra-pop futuristic room. Then everything dissolves behind a yellow glow...",

They are still making love on the bed on all fours opposite the window. Morning has broken and the sun's rays light the room with a yellow gleam that is almost white in parts. The beat thuds out again, accompanying the couple's quickening breathing as Mario's thrusting gets more violent and mechanical. He grips Moira's shoulders. She moans and, half turning round, bites his hand. My vision gets progressively blurred. The image flickers all over t place. As I fly down towards them, what remains of the ectoplasm seems to be being re-absorbed into Moira's body.

I am now right near them. Their bodies perspire. Their torsos rock to and fro Moira is coming. I go even closer to my sister's moist belly.

At the end of this hollowed-out red fringe is the ovule, which looks like a kind of huge fibrous sponge and seems to be lit from the inside. Rough-hued spermatozoids approach it, like white parasites. They squirm rapidly. Each one has a head and a vibratile tail, linked together by an intermediary segment as long as the head and made of multiple spirals. A first spermatozoid accosts the surface of the ovule. It rushes head-first into the ovular cytoplasm and penetrate the pellucid membrane. It's tail breaks off, abandoned at the surface. Other spermatozoids try to penetrate the membrane. Too late: the route is barred. Once the first fertilizing see been let in, no others can penetrate the surface. My vision penetrates into the cytoplasm behind the spermatozoid. Inside, a most singular phenomenon occurs: it turns head over tail, performing a kind of somersault. Then it carries on progressing into the ovule, but now preceded by the intermediary segment that had initially been following. 198 \fThe male nucleus puffs up, absorbing protoplasmic liquid.
