The floor is covered in urine. It collects in a big halo around the toilet. And there’s other stuff on the floor too. Its disgusting. So your wife mops it up. She dunks her mop in the urine-water, takes the same mop into the kitchen and mops that floor, where your babies crawl on their hands and knees and drop their pacifier, and then they stick that pacifier back in their mouths. While this is happening, your wife is trying to wring the thing out, chapping her hands, breaking her back and eventually getting down on her hands and knees to finish the job that the mop can’t do. She spends most of her day this way, getting up and down on and off of the floor.
