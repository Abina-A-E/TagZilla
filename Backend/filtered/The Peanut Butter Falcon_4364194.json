He looks at the compromised prison bars on his window, in on doing it right this time. He begins stretching like a weekend jogger. He touches hi toes and stretches his torso from side to side. He takes a few deep breaths, nostrils flare. He cracks his neck and hits his chest with a closed fist. He picks up the bottle of Carl’s liquid soap and squirts into his hands. Zak lathers up his stomach, his back, and arms. Finally, he puts it all over his face. He reaches out and grabs the bars... .+.-puts one leg through easily... .--his torso hits the bars and stops. Zak groans and forces his body through the opening. His face, still not through the gap, smashes together mak his lips purse. He breathes harder. His skin bunches up, glistening from the soap; as it give way, he slides through the bars. Zak grins, and takes off across the lawn. Carl smiles and waves goodbye from behind the bent bars. Zak is running across the lawn in slow motion. He glisten the moonlight. EXT.
