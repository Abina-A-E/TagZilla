Then he notices a BATTERED OLD KEYBOARD set up near the back. He walks over, stares down at it. CLOSE ON JON’S FACE - a faint frown, thinking stopped. Almost by itself, his hand reaches out and he begins to play - just a little three note figure. And it fits. As the song begins to swell, Jon’s other hand joins the first and he begins to play along. Then Frank lifts the mic he’s holding and begins to sing - and it’s one of the strangest sounds you could imagine. Beautiful and ridiculous at the same time. Jon is lost in the ecstacy of the moment - the realization of a dream. Then it is abruptly over. The audience are staring in silence, unsure what just happened - not that any of the band are paying them any attention anyway. Clara has noticed FLAMES licking out the back of her synthesiser. More irritated than alarmed, she uses an old scorched towel to beat out the flames, burning her hand in the process. Across the stage, Baraque has already begun the bass line to the next song.",
