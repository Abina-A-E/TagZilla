He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's been around for three decades. He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too- worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off.
