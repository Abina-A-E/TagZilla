Punishes him as they roll in the red dust... but Santen begins to slow. His breath has been growing labored. He's now gasping for air. Stops. Darts a look at his readout. Still has some air. But the exertion has been too much. The suit's depleted supply can't feed him what he needs fast enough. He lets go of Pettengill. Hypoxia overcoming him. Crawls away on hands and knees.
