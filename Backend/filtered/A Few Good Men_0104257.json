A few minutes later,  a chemical reaction in Santiago's  body called lactic acidosis caused  his lungs to begin bleeding. He  drowned in his own blood and was  pronounced dead at 32 minutes past  midnight. These are the facts of the  case. And they are undisputed. That's  right. The story I just told you is  the exact same story you're going to  hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's  the exact same story you're going to  hear from Private Downey.

I'm an  educated man, but I'm afraid I can't  speak intelligently about the travel  habits of William Santiago.  What I  do know is that he was set to leave  the base at 0600. Now are these really  the questions I was called here to  answer? Phone calls and footlockers?  Please tell me you've got something  more, Lieutenant. Please tell me  there's an ace up your sleeve. These  two marines are on trial for their  lives. Please tell me their lawyer  hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone  bill. (beat) Do you have any other questions for  me, counselor?",
