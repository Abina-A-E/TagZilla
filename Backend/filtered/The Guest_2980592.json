The man in the army uniform continues to run as an old PICK-UP TRUCK appears in the distance behind him. INT. ANNA’S CAR - EARLY MORNING —- CONTINUOUS ANNA PETERSON, a pretty 20 year old with dark hair, drives the pick-up truck down the country road. Her eyes are tired and her mascara smeared, as if she has been up all night. Anna looks through her windshield at the man running on the side of the road. He is running in the same direction that Anna is driving, so she sees only his back. Anna frowns slightly at this sight, then continues driving, moving past the young man as he runs along. Glancing at her rearview mirror, Anna watches his figure recede into the distance behind her.",

David’s eyes narrow, peering at the hiding space. Luke holds his breath. His hands shake slightly. David takes a step forward, towards the stack of barrels. He holds the box cutter out in front of him. A CRASHING sound comes from the other side of the barn, that of a MIRROR SHATTERING.

David is NO LONGER ON THE FLOOR in front of her. Anna spins around and is STABBED IN THE LEG with the box cutter BLADE. It tears into her flesh through her tights.

It falls forward, onto a bale of HAY. Its LANTERN sends FLAMES out onto the hay. David WRENCHES the pistol from Anna’s grasp. It goes skittering across the floor, disappearing into the fog. David reaches out and GRABS Anna’s NECK with both hands. He tightens his grip, CHOKING HER. They struggle, both of them crouched in the fog on the dance floor, MUSIC BLARING. Anna CLAWS at David's hands as he compresses the arteries in her neck. She struggles, going to her knees, frantically trying to pull back his fingers. David exhales with exertion.
