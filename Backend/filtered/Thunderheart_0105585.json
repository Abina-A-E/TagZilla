A sphere of contained fire, undula in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha S sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular. The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher.  Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and  foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it.  Slowly. BEGIN CREDITS. Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wak Tanka - The Great Mystery. And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a he comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLO MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The IND MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around hi neck. Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... hi heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song. And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff,  airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crims mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly  overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gu which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him.  Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quick and violently as a deer shot dead. LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly.",
