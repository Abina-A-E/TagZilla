When a  giraffe starts to eat the  tree's leaves, the shaking  branch acts like an alarm. The  ants charge out and secrete an  acid onto the giraffe's  tongue. The giraffe learns its  lesson and never returns.  Without each other, the tree  would be picked dry and the  ants would have no shade from  the brutal African sun Both  would die.
