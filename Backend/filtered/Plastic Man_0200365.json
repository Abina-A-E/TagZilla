Our world is a cage; the laboratory beyond the wire mesh has the sprawling limitlessness of a universe with dark endless voids and immense technological instruments gleaming with celestial light. We can hear a WOMAN'S VOICE though we can't understand what she is saying. There are several other lab mice in our cage and as the voice gets closer there is sense of mounting apprehension We fight the other mice, pushing into the far corner. Suddenly the world beyond the mesh is eclipsed by the WOMAN. If we were not a mouse, we might think she was beautiful. She opens the cage and a panic erupts. There is nowhere to hide as her hand reaches in and TAKES HOLD of us. The cage seems to fall away as she LIFTS us. We can barely hear her voice over the blood pounding in our ears. She TURNS us OVER and we see an enormous hypodermic needl that she uses to inject us with a sapphire-blue fluid. We are then placed in a small air-tight tank. There is a small Plexiglas window and several tiny holes. After a moment we hear the HISS of VALVES OPENING. A milky fluid suddenly floods the chamber and we begin to feel nauseous, our VISION BLURRING and DISTORTING. As quickly as the fluid filled the tank it now drains. The god-like hand again LIFTS us from the tank but something is wrong because -- We SLIP THROUGH her fingers. \fThe GROUND RUSHES UP at us but when we hit -- We BOUNCE. And BOUNCE. FLIP FLOPPING, the bounces coming quicker and quicker, LOWER and LOWER until we are RACING ACROSS the floor. Free! We see the woman in her white lab coat screaming at her assistant as they try to corral us. We DODGE, ZIPPING ACROSS the floor, looking for a way out when we see, set in the tile floor, a drain. The WORLD SWIRLS WITH us as we DASH TOWARDS it, the dark holes widening as we DIVE at them, PLUNGING HEADLONG INTO",
