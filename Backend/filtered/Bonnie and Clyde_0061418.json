As the camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we have been looking into a mirror.  She is standing before full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up.  She overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and s forth.  As the film progresses her make-up will be refine until, at the end, there is none. The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly throughout the first part of this scene.  As the camera continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that BONNIE i naked.  Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the audience, but implied.  That is, she should be \"covered\" various ways from the camera's P.O.V., but the audience m be aware of her exposure to CLYDE later in the scene.  Th is the only time in the film that she will ever be this exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience.  Her attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with narcissism. The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower- class frame house in West Dallas, Texas.  The neighborhoo is low income.  Though the room reveals its shabby surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by BONNIE to fix up.  Small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops o the bureaus, vanity tables, etc. (Little glass figurines porcelain statuettes and the like.) BONNIE finishes admiring herself.  She walks from the mir and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposit wall.  The shade is up.  There are no curtains.  She look out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down w her. EXT. BEDROOM.  BONNIE'S P.O.V.  DAY. Over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the gar connected to the house.  There is an old car parked in th driveway, its windows open.  We see a man walking up the driveway, somewhat furtively.  He is a rather dapper fell dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a straw boater.  It is CLYDE BARROW.  Obviously, he is abou to steal the car.  He looks it over, checking around him make sure no passers-by are coming.  He peers inside the front window to see if the keys are in the ignition.  He studies the dashboard.
