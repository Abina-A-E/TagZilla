A few girls giggle, others roll their eyes and yawn. Before the Teacher finally goes to the board and slowly writes out: “LOVE AND SACRIFICE” \f14. NUN TEACHER (CONT’D) Love and Sacrifice. Of course there are many different ways, that people choose to show gratitude to their Lord ... But I believe what differentiates the Catholic religion, from so many other religions, is the full extent we’re willing to go to demonstrate our passion...

Before all out of nowhere the room falls silent. And just as none other than REVEREND MOTHER MARIE SAINT CLARE, 56- A frank, tough as nails clergy woman of the old style, who occasionally lets her under developed emotions get the better of her- Finally enters. Reverend Mother quietly makes her way to the front of the room, flanked by her most loyal lieutenant, Sister Genevieve. Her mere presence so halting and domineering, as to already put the fear of God in these girls. Now Reverend Mother just stands at the head of the room, looking over all the girls.

I’m also the Mother Superior, or Abbess, of this particular Order of Sisters of Beloved Rose. I myself have been a Rose nearly 40 years now. Meaning some 40 years ago, I first walked through those gates as a Postulant- same as all of you- Now 40 years later, I’ve not once set foot outside those gates since... She pauses looking around at all the girls. We watch Cathleen’s eyes lower, trying to avoid her gaze. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D) So what is my role, my job here exactly?.... Well as far as all of you are concerned- You might consider me like the voice of God around here... Meaning that unfortunately, since God can’t be here to run this convent Himself- My voice will serve as a stand in for His. And whenever you hear this very voice speak from my mouth- You can expect it’s on behalf of his wishes. \f24. She pauses again, making sure they all heard it. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D) Now during the next 2 and a half years of your training to become nuns here, I personally will be separating the wheat from the chafe, determining which of you actually belong. As opposed to which are simply the victims of a childish imagination.... And that’s because here in this room, in this monastery- God is not a fantasy to us. Not a daydream, not a fantasy. And he’s certainly not your invisible best friend either.... To the contrary, God is work. Hard work. The work of a very special kind of love, you’re all going to be trained in. Turning to look at all the girls, we see a multitude of intimidated faces. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D) So you'll be spending your first 6 months as postulants. After that, and for those of you who make it- You’1l be invited to take your very first vows, in your first temporary marriage to Christ- And enter the Novitiate... However and as a rule, we make a point never to discuss the Novitiate until we’ve been through it ourselves. So for now, you’ll just have to wait. Cathleen looks up, so curious by the notion of the Novitiate. As all the girls are. REVEREND MOTHER(CONT’D) Finally, let’s talk about silence for a moment. Because we observe two types of silence here: Regular Silence and Grand Silence... Now during regular silence, if you find you need to speak for whatever reason. That’s permissible... However and starting at 9pm each night, when you hear that last bell signifying the start of Grande Silence. That means you - Don’t. Talk. Period. We hear a general nervous MURMUR throughout the room. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D) Are there any questions? \f25. The room is then deadened, nobody daring to speak. Before some brave young girl in the back raises her hand. However and instead of calling on her, Reverend Mother just looks at the girl blankly for an extremely long time. Beat. It’s awkward. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D) Put your hand down sister, postulants don’t have questions. And you are free to go home. She then turns backs to the group as a whole. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D) Now, when you return to your cells later this evening... INT. POSTULANT DORMITORY. MAIN HALL -— DAWN Gazing down the empty hallway in the Postulant dormitory, all is quiet- Before suddenly SISTER ANNE together with SISTER KATE, take the same wooden CLAPPER and start clapping and rattling all the way down the hall. INT. POSTULANT’S CELLS - MORNING A couple of the new POSTULANTS- Sisters SISSY and EVELYN- immediately jolt from sleep, practically falling out of bed and straight onto the floor. They then fumble through their prayers, fighting back the intermittent slew of sighs and yawns. INT. CATHLEEN’S CELL - MORNING Meanwhile in Cathleen’s cell, she herself is already wide awake, fully dressed in her new POSTULANT UNIFORM, and waiting on the edge of her bed. As if so determined to not be late, she literally stayed up all night. Cathleen adjusts and readjusts herself a couple times, before the clapper then finally makes its way to her door. Now she too drops and heads for the floor. \fBlue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 26.",

As if the shame of the act is something she can actually out race by doing it fast enough. Finally reaching a climax she drops her head down, breathing heavily. Her eyes drift off and stare at the floor and for a second, it almost looks like she might cry. This is a woman in a lot more secret pain and confusion than even she herself realizes. \f45. INT.

It is no longer acceptable to view any acts of suffering, self-punishment, or extreme sacrifice - as an act of love, or way to gain favor with our Lord. We, as Catholics, need to learn to understand love in a different way... Finally, from here forward and in the eyes of both the church and God alike, the status of all nuns will be reduced as equal to that of any regular practicing Catholic. While the choice to enter the convent remains one’s own, this does not necessarily make nuns any more ‘beloved’ or ‘special’ in God’s eyes. We hear a few GASPS through the room, before everyone is suddenly silent. Total devastation. A few sisters then begin to cry.
