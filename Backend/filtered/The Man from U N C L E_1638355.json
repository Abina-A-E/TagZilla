Year merged with miserable year, as life continued to be a living hell. But what the other boys didn’t understand about their victim, is that he didn’t see them as enemies. He saw them as instruments of learning. A priceless lesson was gleaned from his tormentors. Man has only two masters in this world. And their names, Mr. Solo, are pain and fear. As the boy grew older, he found he had an extraordinary talent for eliciting these gods in others. So, on the principle of playing to your strengths, he decided to make their cultivation his life’s work. Fortunately for this boy, history presented an unprecedented opportunity, a world war. You may have heard of the Dark Angel of Ravensberg, the Butcher of Belsen, or my favorite, the Fifth Horseman, Doctor Apocalypse. What history has failed to relate is that this was not three individuals, but the tireless work of a single artist.
