To me, there is no better way to celebrate our Nation's independence than through the courage of you young men. Also, I'd like to thank the Veteran's Administration for giving us this day, and for providing us with 2 schedule of non-stop competition. We'll be starting off with the track and field events, and any of you boys that are interested in competing, you just run’ down Pat Miller, he'll sign you up. I do want to caution you all to steer clear of the javelin, discus and shot put areas, keep your eyes open and practice ‘safety first.' (he turns) . Marge, do you have the program? . (she rises, hands it to him) Thank you. Later in the day, Marge will be conducting the old Bingo game, you *on't want to miss that: (reads program, Marge leaves stand) After the.field events, we'll have the wheelchair slalom, six volts. Directly following thet, we'll have the grand slalom, and that, friends, will be the big one, twelve volts? reads) I want you all to be sure and drop by the weight lifting competition, I think you'll be astounded at what some of these youngsters can do. We'll have the finals coming up very soon in the archery tournement, and, from what I've seen, we've got a flock of Robin Hoods on hand today, believe me. (Marge comes up, hands him note) Aha! Gordon Dickson is challenging all comers at the ping pong table -- he'll take anybody on -- one at a time --.two : at a time, it doesn't matter to hin, ’ old Gordy is a whiz with that paddle.

Fourth Means To Me’, and asked to express theiz thoughts in essay form. Well, let me tell you, I spent a few sleepless nights before I could come up with a winner, they were all just first-rate, but, I finally had to settle on a doozie, by none other than Willie Mason!

That was a little place in Eastern Oregon called Baker. It used to be a pretty busy town back then., did a lot of gold mining and jumbering. My father was a rancher. It isn't much now, the mines have closed and the trees ain't what they used to be, but I remember it like it was. Seems like my mother spent days cooking for the picnic, and around about July - first,-my’pa's mind would start wanderin' and he wouldn't give a damn about the cattle, That got us kids pretty excited, lookin' forward to all that food and the skyrockets and all. At the park, they'd have flags flyin' and games of chance, kissing booths and wrestling matches. But let me tell you, no matter what they had there to keep me busy, that day was always too long for me. I wanted the sun to go down, ‘cause when it got dark, th. band would pley the Stars Spangled Bes ner and the fireworks would start up. 1‘d just lie back on the grass and watch them things explode, and I'd start thinkin' about how brave those men were that fought in the Revolution. I'd dream about those men, how they went to war for our freedom. I guess that's when I decided to be a soldier, lying in the grass seeing the sky lit up with those rockets, hearing that music. I enlisted when I became of age, I served in Europe in World War 11 and was involved in the . liberation of dozens of towns. As I passed through them, as I saw the faces of the people, I realized I had fulfilled my dream, I had become one of those men who had gone to war for freedom. Anyway, I sure wound up doing what I wanted to, and that's what freedom means, and that's what July Fourth means to me. \f60 yy CONTINUED; Players scrambling for fumbled ball. A completed pass.
