So they get together that night, they have a date, they go and eat, they have a beautiful : and great dinner....they're both a little nervous, though. So outside the restaraunt, they have their first kiss -- and it's beautiful and sweet and perfect. So they look at each other and he says, “Come stay with me, let's go back to my apartment.\" They agree -- but then he remembers he's got his roommate and all this so it won't work out. She's staying with her parents so that won't really work - but she tells him she has this empty apartment that she's about to move into but there's nothing in it -- no water, or heat, electricity, just a matress -- well they finally decide and say, \"All we need is a matress, let's go to the apatment.\" So they go back...they have sex and it's great...no first time jitters, nothing awkward, it's just like....perfect, right? Perfect sex and they're totally, totally in love. Afterwards, they're in bed, they're naked and holding each other in their arms and she starts feeling his body, she feels his back and she says, \"You're so skinny, I never realized you were so skinny.\" He says, \"No I'm not...\" And he stands up -~ and he's showing her his body, he says, \"It's all muscle, y'know, look:\" So he turns his back to her : and lifts his arms up like this -~ and he tightens up, flexing his back muscles real hard and -- BOOM! This projectial terd shoots right out of his butt and lands SMACK on her neck....this poo hits her right on the neck -- Now remember, they're in this apartment with no towels, no water, nothing -- so they get up -- get dressed, they drive down to a gas station and they have to hose her off -- they hose this poo off her neck -- and then he drove her to her parents house and that was it -- they never spoke again -~ can you believe that?
