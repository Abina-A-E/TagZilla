It was alleged that while Lee  Kinsolving slept, perhaps in a  drunken stupor and perhaps not,  the Defendant removed the neck  brace from his neck and jerked his  head sufficiently to rupture the  spinal cord and cause death. It is  admitted that the Defendant was  found holding the neck brace in  her hand, and bending over her  husband's body, which was lying on  the bed. Not in the bed, mind you,  but sprawled across it.  The  Defendant has testified that lee  Kinsolving himself removed the  neck brace to torment her, as it  were, with the great danger in  which this placed him. Then he  started to walk towards her, holding  the brace in his hands, and that  being unsteady on his feet, he  stumbled and fell backwards across  the bed. And this fall broke his  neck, although at the time she did  not know it. She has testified  that she picked the brace up from  the floor and was about to attempt  to replace it on his neck when her  father-in-law entered the room and  found her in that position.
