Next to it a car speaker playing the sound. \fThwump. Thwump. Thwump. The record is stuck. Polished shoes lie a short distance from the player. Connected to the shoes, a MAN lies on his side with his back exposed. Wears a well-tailored suit and clipper- trimmed hair. Sweat beads on the back of his neck. The light dims and sways just above the man. In front of the man, a part of the cabinвЂ™s cramped interior looks down upon the man. The aluminum door in the center. On the sides covering almost every available space, PHOTOS. Tacked haphazardly, the photos, each one of a morbid, bloodied child-figure. Several photos of each victim from different angles.
