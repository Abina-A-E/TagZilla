I wanted  to tear my teeth out.  I didn't  know what I wanted to do.  And I  want to remember it.  I never want  to forget it.  I never want to  forget it.

Perfect,  genuine, complete, crystalline,  pure.  And then I realized, they  were stronger than we.  Because  they could stand it.  These were  not monsters.  These were men,  strained cadres.  These men who  fought with their hearts, who have  families, who have children, who  are filled with love...that they  had the strength, the strength to  do that.  If I had ten divisions  of those men, then our troubles  here would be over very quickly.
