The holiday just isn't the same. No siree. Charlie BELCHES. Steven shoots him a stern look. STEVEN (cont'd) Excuse you. (beat) Now when I was your age, Halloween was different. The kid rolls his eyes. He knows he’s in for it. He reach into the bowl again, about to grab the caramel apple-- but takes another candy bar instead. STEVEN (cont’d) Back then it was a real holiday, about tradition, and family. Why my dad and I would spend hours carving pumpkins and making caramel apples. With real caramel! Not this bag of chocolate for two bucks at Wal-Mart stuff. Do you even know what the heck goes into this junk? Charlie just GRUNTS. Steven looks at the bowl of candy, s the apple still sitting there. He continues, gets more passionate, waving and poking the knife while he speaks.. STEVEN (cont'd) The magic is gone. I mean look at this... (points at empty street) Years ago this street was filled with vampires, zombies, werewolves, maybe a cute little witch or two. Charlie sighs. When will this guy shut up? STEVEN (cont’d) Now everyone’s afraid of Satanists, or serial killers, or God knows what else. Can you believe that? A perfectly innocent holiday-- ruined. \f3/21/03 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 21. Steven SWIPES THE KNIFE close to Charlie’s face. Too clos NOW he's nervous. Without taking his eyes off the knife, finally GRABS THE CARAMEL APPLE. Takes a bite. STEVEN (cont’d) Why if I saw one of those freaks wandering around my house, you can bet I'd...I'd... THUNK! Steven STABS the knife into the pumpkin. Smiles. Charlie is making short work of the apple. The boy COUGHS His eyes are wide. Startled. Worried. Steven sees his fea STEVEN (cont‘d) Sorry. He yanks the knife out, delicately wipes away pumpkin goo Charlie slowly munches, never taking his eyes off the bla STEVEN (cont’d) Yup, those were the days. Homemade costumes... Charlie COUGHS.

CHARLIE DROPS THE APPLE and doubles over in agony, trying hack up something in his throat. Steven pats the boy’s ba trying to help, but it doesn’t do any good. His face is b HE’S CHOKING. Charlie gawks at Steven, eyes pleading. Steven casually picks up the apple, breaks off a small pi and uncovers A SMALL RAZOR BLADE covered in caramel and blood. STEVEN (cont‘d) Well now...how about that? \f3/21/03 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 22. THE BOY COUGHS AGAIN and a wet mix of BLADES, NAILS, AND SHARDS OF GLASS, fall from his bleeding mouth. He claws a Steven, begging for help. Steven just coldly stares at hi STEVEN (cont'd) Trick or treat. Charlie gags once more, and slumps to the ground-- dead.
