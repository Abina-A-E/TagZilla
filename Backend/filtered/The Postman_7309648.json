Bethlehem reaches for his sword. But before it clears the scabbard, The Postman lunges. The horses collide. Bethlehem and The Postman hit the ground hard. Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look. The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes. It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists -- especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in tighter. Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches. One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise. It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand -- grabs The Postman's throat with the other.",
