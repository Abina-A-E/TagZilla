This DMT --  dimethyltryptamine -- trial is the  first such study to be approved by  the FDA, so forgive us if we err on  the side of caution. We have chosen  DMT as the pioneer psychotropic  compound for several reasons: it  naturally occurs in the body, evident  in such states as schizophrenia and  manic depression. To the extent that  we can understand why Serotonin is  affected by DMT, we might unlock  some of the mysteries for such  disabling disorders. Second, it is  an intense drug. The visions will be  strong. Third, it's short acting.  It's in and out fast. Should anyone  have an unpleasant experience, at  least it will be over quickly. All  of you have previous experiences  with psychedelic drugs, some extensive  experience. This will be a much more  controlled environment. 1.0 mg/kg of  dimethyltryptamine will be injected  intramuscularly, not smoked as is  the usual practice. This retards the  speed at which the drug becomes  effective, but it's the only way to  be sure everyone receives the same  dosage. You've all signed the informed  consent forms, but I wanted to take  this opportunity to invite your  friends and relatives to an open  forum. If anyone has any questions,  please ask.

Don Macit ladles out the ayauasca brew into two cups on the table. cup contains almost twice as much brew as the other. Don Macita blows purifying smoke on Garwood and Russell. Allison and Hume sit to the side. He puts his arm around shoulders. Russ looks at his fingernails: they are rimmed blue from purifying dye. Don Macita places the cup with the larger dose in Russell hands, the other in Vince's, then steps and begins to sin the soft, lilting icaros: \"Maimandara shamuirimum, Yana p chicunaca...\" TIMECUT. Night. Garwood and Russell both bent over a long basin, vomiting. \"La Purga.\" Russ watches his vomit as the camera zooms toward his eye enters his myriatic pupil. INSIDE RUSS' MIND: his vomit emerges as blood, covering t floor, liquefying it. In the blood swim thousands of vibr worms. The characteristic crackle, the rising hum (DMT particles crashing into the brain's synapses) as the worms, animate like sperm, jump bullet-like from the bloody below, pierc our skin. The voyage has begun. Russell's pupil expands, revealing the vast geography of  hyperspace. Space first appears as GEOMETRIC FORMS, revolving  kaleidoscopically. These quickly assume vegetable form, an inviting cardinal red CHRYSANTHEMUM, its petals beckoning, becoming a white LOTUS blossom. Into the blossom we fly, its core opening onto the JUNGLE canopy. We fly over the jungle, compelling images filling our fie of vision: birds unlike any ever beheld, rippling trees a fauna, indistinguishable creatures in the undergrowth. To our left: the waterfall where dead souls bathe. We are the panther. We know this because we hear the pant heart beating, hear its paws pounding the earth's surface see its paws before us. We dive toward the surface. Into the jungle the panther  plunges. But it is not a jungle, it is an OCEAN and we are under t water now, swimming shark-like alongside pink dolphins an glowing fish of the deep. Great primordial creatures, sea monsters extinct for eons, pass. We burst from the ocean Atlantis-like into a realm of RUI PALACES and LABYRINTHINE CITIES. Empty unpopulated empire rise and fall. African mud cities become Palantine temples; pyramids bec decayed skyscrapers. Throughout melodies mix with the music, snippets of sound contemporary and archaic. A guitar riff from the Fifties, bit of Beethoven, third world instruments. Then, for a moment, above the ruins: a cascade of ADVERTI IMAGERY: the pop culture of signs, slogans and logos rush past. In the ruined cities, we enter the HALL OF ANCESTORS. We our shadow before us, morphing the history of earth's lif forms: sea-going, reptilian, mammalian, ape-like, humanoi The ancestors are stacked in high-rise rows to our right left. All of mankind's faces, Neanderthal, Homo-sapien,  yellow, white, black -- some surprised, some merely curio morphing one to the other like falling dominos. At the top level, we notice, are the gods -- primitive,  ancient unrecognizable divinities yielding to more famili figures: the Egyptian hierarchy, the Greek pantheon, Nord gods and goddesses, the manifestations of Buddha, the Hin cosmology, Mohammed and his followers, Christ and the sai yet, looking closer, we see they are in pain, all writhin like crucified Jesuses.
