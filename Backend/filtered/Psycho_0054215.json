We are  close now, so that only the lower half of the window fram is in shot. No sounds come from within the room. Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room. A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wea a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitud of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome  conflicts.
