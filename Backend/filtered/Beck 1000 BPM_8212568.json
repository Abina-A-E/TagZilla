D'Leh immediately starts to move faster than the others, getting a bit ahead of the group. \f10. Tic'Tic makes a CLICKING INSECT SOUND, getting D'Leh’s attention. Tic'Tic motions for D'Leh to ease back, to sta tighter with the advancing group. D’Leh reluctantly slows, waiting for the others, joining them, then pacing himself to stay with them. The hunters advance on the herd. Tic'Tic leads. The anima pick up their scent and begin to stir. Tic'Tic signals the hunters. They stop in a long, curving row. Tic'Tic continues, alone, moving deeper and deeper into t herd. He passes the female mammoth and her baby, very clo The baby eyes him curiously. Tic'Tic zeros in on a giant mammoth, the LEAD BULL. Tic'T carefully approaches. Sensing movement, the lead bull tur menacingly towards the approaching Tic'Tic. The other mammoths in the herd react to the lead bull’s movement, and they turn as well. A pause, then they begin grazing again. Tic'Tic creeps closer still. The lead bull stops eating. His trunk sniffs the air and animal makes a RUMBLING sound. The lead bull looks down towards Tic'Tic, trying to spot him with near-sighted eye D’Leh eases forward a bit. Ka’ren, and some of the other hunters, note D'Leh’s movement. They’re not pleased. Suddenly, directly in front of the lead bull, Tic'Tic lea to his feet, waving his arms, SHOUTING wildly. The lead bull’s feet tear up the ground. His massive head whips back and forth. Tic'Tic stands his ground. He goes closer to the lead bul and thrusts his spear at the animal's face. THE MAMMOTH CHARGES. Tic'Tic ROLLS out of the way, barely avoiding being trampled. Tic'Tic BLOWS HIS HUNTING WHISTLE. At that signal, D'Leh and the other hunters leap to their feet, waving their arms and SHOUTING. The rest of the herd, spooked and furious, SNORTS, TRUMPE some rearing up on their hind legs. \f11. The herd charges after the lead bull with a sound like rolling thunder. Their stampede leads them into a valley. Far in the dista we make out a rock formation, a wide opening, which we la learn will lead into an increasingly narrow canyon. Tic'Tic joins the other hunters, running, giving them han signals, deploying them. The hunters form themselves into crescent, behind and to the sides of the running mammoths herding them, directing the big animals towards the canyo opening. D'Leh runs alongside the herd, point man of one side of t crescent. D'Leh, focused only on the mammoths, and not on other hunters, runs faster, putting distance between hims and the others. Tic'Tic sees D'Leh and CALLS OUT angrily to him, motionin him back with the group, but the thunderous sounds of the mMammoths’ stampede drowns out Tic'Tic’s voice. Ka'ren looks angrily ahead at D’Leh. Moha and Lu'Kibu see D'Leh ahead of the group, and exchange an angry look. Picking up speed, D’Leh gets further ahead of the other hunters. D'Leh is now running ahead of some of the trailing mammot and some of those animals veer to the outside of D’Leh, driving him in among the main herd. Tic'Tic sees this happen. His anger grows, but there’s nothing he can do about it. We _ see big boulders looming ahead. With D'Leh running among them, two of the mammoths in the center of the herd are spooked and start to veer off, awa from the mouth of the canyon. Other mammoths in the herd respond, and start to veer awa from the canyon mouth as well. Tic'Tic sees the herd starting to change direction becaus D'Leh. Tic'Tic motions to Ka'ren, Moha, and Lu’Kibu, who tighten up on their side of the herd, yelling, driving th herd back toward the canyon mouth. The lead bull has passed the boulders, and now every anim has to choose its route. \f12. D'Leh runs between two massive animals who want to squeez between two of the giant stone boulders. They scrape the and their bodies crash together. D'Leh’s only chance is to duck down and dive under the bo of one of the stampeding mammoths. For a couple of endles seconds he runs under the animal. But when the mammoth jumps over a smaller rock, which is high for D'Leh, he has no choice other than to jump aside tumbling to the ground, where he’s nearly crushed by the of the other mammoths. Ka'ren, Moha, and Lu'Kibu shoot him harsh looks as they p D'Leh scrambles up, but he has lost his lead.

The ropes rip away from the rocks! The baby mammoth follows and nearly gets caught in the to ropes.

As the CAMERA MOVES UP, we see that the animal is racing towards a steep cliff. D'Leh still struggles to free his hand from the net. The mammoth passes a rock, the net gets caught in it and comes loose. D'Leh rolls to a stop. The mammoth comes to an abrupt halt at the cliff’s edge. D'Leh is barely conscious. Dazed and hurt, he struggles t get up. The bull turns toward him. It REARS and BELLOWS in anger pain! D'Leh continues to try to free himself from the net. The bull charges, thundering down on him. Unable to free hand, D'Leh can only jump out of the way. The bull, unabl change direction as quickly as D'Leh, barely misses him. \f16. D’Leh rolls to his knees, still struggling.

This time, the bull does not charge immediately. D'Leh an the mammoth stand opposite one another, neither moving. O man against a mammoth, impossible odds.

D'Leh b up, holding the three spears, looking around for cover. Nothing, other than a few flat rocks. THE MAMMOTH CHARGES... D'Leh throws the first spear. It is a good throw, but it misses.

He backs away, holding the last spear pointed at the mamm Without looking, he backs into a rock outcropping, and th butt of the spear becomes wedged between two rocks. THE MAMMOTH IS NEARLY UPON HIM... D'Leh tries to free the spear, but there is no more time. At a full run, the mammoth hits the spear, which sinks de into its chest, but does not slow the momentum of the hea beast. D'Leh scrambles over some low rocks and dives between two them.

As the pit is situated on a slight incline, the water rushes in over th side of the pit as well. \f58. In the eerie moonlight, he can just make out the dimensio of the pit-- fifteen feet deep, with overhanging walls of packed earth. His spear gleams in the shadows on the far end of the pit D'Leh gets to his feet and walks between the spikes to retrieve it. He reaches out to grab his spear and out of the darkness- A_huge SABER TOOTH TIGER lunges at him! Six inch teeth sn at D'Leh! The animal lets out a terrifying ROAR! And D'Leh jumps backwards and screams! Lightning flashes again, and we see the Tiger is STUCK, pinned beneath one of the logs that once covered the trap Blood trickles from a wound on his side. The Tiger strugg to free itself, but its movements are futile. The animal finally lets out a FRUSTRATED and TERRIFYING R which makes the VULTURES tear into flight in a frenzy. D'Leh realizes with concern that the water is rising fast and faster. This is a desperate situation. He decides to try to climb the walls, but they are too slippery from the rain and he falls back into the pit, ne getting impaled on one of the spikes - again. He has now cheated death a second time in this pit. He slowly gets to his feet and assesses the situation. It clear that this is a place of death. There is no clear wa scaling the wall - nothing long enough to reach the rim. Until he notices the log which pins down the tiger. It’s broken branches could make for a ladder. The Tiger struggles. Unfamiliar territory for the predato D'Leh makes a decision. Very carefully, he begins to move towards the Tiger. He looks the Tiger in the eye. D’ LEH Ssshh...I understand your anger, brother hunter, but I did not make this trap. The tiger GROWLS, RUMBLING, glaring at D'Leh, who continu to speak very softly. \f59. D’'LEH (CONT'D) Perhaps we can make a bargain. I need this piece of tree and I will set you free... The water keeps rising... D'Leh reaches the log that has the Tiger pinned. The Tige struggles more and more with the desperate situation. He watches D'Leh, who continues coming closer and closer. D’'LEH (CONT'D) It is not just me, brother hunter. There are others. If I die here, it is bad for them. Better if we both live.. The Tiger does not move. D'Leh takes another step closer, heart in his throat. D’'LEH (CONT'D) Sssh-- Do not eat me when I set you free. D'Leh touches the log. The Tiger struggles as the water rises. D'Leh makes his decision. He pushes hard on the log. Trying to roll it fr of the Tiger. The animal GROWLS again with its chin dragging in the mud water. D'Leh pushes harder on the log. It starts to shift He strains and pushes with all his might.",

Without looking back at Tic'Tic or Nakudu-- HE WALKS INTO THE GORGE... The others watch as D'Leh walks on a path that takes him right between the tigers. He walks steadily, to all appearances, calmly. D'Leh’s eyes show a different story. He half-expects to b ripped to pieces at any moment, but, with his back to the others, he doesn’t show it. Nor does he breathe. Soon everybody follows him at a safe distance with Tic'Ti bringing up the rear of the group. The huge cats, lurking in the grass, circle the men as th pass. The tension rises even higher as a few of the tiger creep in close. They are now only a few feet away. But D'Leh stays the course and continues to lead the men through the center of the pack. Beads of sweat form on hi brow. When they finally reach safe ground, he exhales and smile Tic'Tic with great relief. Nakudu and his men stare at hi awe. Tic'Tic steps up next to D'Leh, and they speak quietly, unheard by the others. TIC’TIC (CONT’D) I hope the Ancient Fathers don’t tire of their games. D’ LEH It wasn’t the Ancient Fathers... D’Leh nods toward the vultures circling the antelope carc Then he motions to the blood on the tigers’ paws and face D’'LEH (CONT'D) My friends were simply not hungry. \f75. Tic'Tic smiles.
