EVE is lying on a darkly iridescent Moroccan fabric. She remains completely motionless. Even her breathing is not perceptible. Berber carpets cover the floors around her. A gentle breeze moves darkly patterned curtains as faint sounds of the night drift in from the balcony: footsteps, voices speaking French and Arabic, a loud Arabic pop song from the radio of a moving car...eventually a distant cal prayer is audible.
