REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D) The antenna will allow us to listen in, across the galaxy, through gravitational waves--seen as the ultimate means of communication through space. Now: footage of MACHINES going this way and that, spinnin lattice of tethers. They’re almost like spiders on a web. Or HYDRAS, with CYCLOPS-LIKE BRIGHT LIGHTS in their cente REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D) Self-replicators are used for its construction. And it’s not just machines; a select few highly- trained folks from the Army Corps of Engineers will have to check every inch of the carbon fiber for flaws. It has proven one of the most demanding jobs on Earth, but these men and women are up to the task. Engineer Major Roy McBride of Las Cruces, New Mexico, says he’s not afraid of the challenge: IMAGE OF FOUR YOUNG MEN and TWO YOUNG WOMEN, seated on a SOFA, in a nondescript office environment with an Army Co of Engineers logo/graphic on a screen behind them. One of them is ROY MCBRIDE. Roy McBride: forties, handsome. His eyes are light blue, seemingly friendly, but reveal little about the man himse He is even-tempered, but one would not call him kind; the is an icy quality to him. Still, he is not overtly cruel petty, and to talk to him, one could never question his intentions or his integrity. Roy speaks slowly, formally, deliberately, as though he d not want ever to repeat himself. He seems guarded, sincer precise, competent. His face is blank but prone to the occasional awkward joke, and those jokes are made almost self-amusement. He does not seem morose. In fact, he smiles all the time, and his face often ligh with little motivation. He speaks with a very slight Midwestern/Western accent. Think Neil Armstrong. As he speaks, on the screen appears the title “Maj. Roy C McBride”.",
