And my mother adores him. He’s a man that’s achieved being truly adored - not because he brings home lots of bacon, but because he deserves to be adored and my mother is of such quality that she recognizes when someone’s truly worthy of being adored and so can’t help but do so...

What do you guys do? Collect garbage, dig ditches, work in the steel mill? Whatever, less I could not care. I assume it ain’t glamorous - you bust your asses, don’t make much dough - boo-hoo, sounds pretty crumby. You’d rather be on television maybe, get laid all the time - eat, sleep - that’s fair, I hear you. Hard work - a buck, something like work - a bundle. Yes, I get laid by beautiful women all the time, the ugliest woman I’ve ever fucked is a thousand times more beautiful than any woman who has ever talked to you and thanks to “Entertainment Tonight” a few of them even know my real name - you think my life is better than your life?

Tomorrow may -- so what do we got? Pete’s had some rough moments lately, but what was most important to him - to find a bona fide nice girl, he has achieved. I predict he’s married with kids by next week. I avoided the electric chair, always good news - and, much to my amazement, have myself met a nice girl - who comes with her own handcuffs, how ‘bout that for a bonus? Our dear friend Al has suffered a very painful blow, but is going to be just fine, because he has loving friends who will be there for him. And Ed, as always, is perfect in every way, because nerds really do rule. That’s it - more tomorrow - the end, because that’s what days do.",
