She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her acro the floor. She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged a bleeding. He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from h waist to do God knows what. Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that she has unhinged her gill knife. As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife  with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade thro his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS. After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody,  wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy ap in the doorway. Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from  behind at full speed, knocking him down. Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to he feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over Greer, bringing it down on his head.",
