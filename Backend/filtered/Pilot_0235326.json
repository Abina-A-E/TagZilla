Cops in heavy riot armor walk through the crowds and crui the traffic in patrol cars which have been retrofitted wi polycarbonate shields over the windows and kevlar armor panels over the doors.  Among those walking with purpose tides of homeless.  The high unemployment caused by the economic collapse has led to a homeless population not se since the Great Depression almost a century before.  They live in makeshift colonies under freeway overpasses, in abandoned cars and parking structures.  They've been livi there for years, some with a lot of creature comforts-- p putt generators running TV sets, that sort of thing.",
