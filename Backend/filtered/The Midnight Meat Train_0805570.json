Bang, the noise suddenly is louder. It seems to come from the next car down. Now it goes back to the quiet slapping The young man looks at the door to the next car. He can’t see anything. The train rattles as it takes a curve. The young man gets up from the bench and takes his briefcase. He walks toward the next car, his attention on the door. ZARUMMMMM!

The window of the door is covered in blood. The young man cannot see through it. He has to get closer, right up to it. His eyes move next to the glass, which reflects red on h POV through the window: We see a huge dark figure, holdin an immense mallet. The figure brings the mallet down, again and again and again, repeatedly pounding, blood hitting the glass in splashes. The young man backs away. He looks around. Outside the train, pitch black. No one else is around. He looks behind him. The car on the other side is dark, empty, no one there. Now the young looks back at the window. The glass is black.

He still grips the shattered bone in his hand. Its tip as sharp as needle. The momentum of swinging the cleaver having carried Mahogany slightly past Leon, Leon drives the broken bone into the back of Mahogany's neck with all his might. Mahogany gags. A rasping, choking sounds come out of his throat. Blood bubbles out of his mouth. Out from around the tip of the bone that now juts from between Mahogany's teeth like a white demonic tongue. Leon has driven the bo all the way thru Mahogany's neck and into his mouth. Mahogany pulls the bone out of his neck. A thin stream of blood pulses across the ground. He presses his hand there trying to slow the loss of blood. Leon stands as Mahogany sinks to his knees. Leon's face contorts with victory. He’s beaten him. But now Leon falls. He is wounded and exhausted. He hits the ground on his knees. Mahogany turns his face up to Leon. There is no trace of fear in his eyes - only relief. A smile twists his lips. Leon's eyes flicker with hate. Mahogany spits, gurgling, trying to form words.",

Not wanting to end-up like the \"meat\" on the train, Leon scrambles backwards thru the bones that litter the cavern floor then, grabbing hold of the cleaver still embedded i his shoulder, he yanks it free.

Leon turn There are more \"Fathers\" behind him. He's surrounded. The cleaver falls to the ground as the \"Fathers\" lift Leo to his feet. He's too weak to even think about fighting them off. He's held up, arms outstretched arms like a scarecrow's. Another clawed hand grabs Leon's chin and forces his face to turn sharply left. Leon has no choice but watch as several \"Fathers\" pass, carrying Mahogany's now naked bod They drop Mahogany to the floor and step back. Just beyond Mahogany's body is absolute darkness save the random highlights cast by the torches of the \"Fathers\". And then these highlights begin to move. What appeared initially to be just a cavern wall is actually the skin o a being so massive that it fills the cavern floor-to- ceiling and continues away from Leon and the \"Fathers\" to an unknowable depth. The bits of skin visible are darkish in color, smooth in texture although thin enough to revea the massive muscles that ripple beneath and consistently wet. This is the \"Grandfather\".",

Slowly, Leon’s breathing recovers and becomes less labore more controlled. The breathing then becomes measured, even. It almost becomes normal breathing, with a slight trembling. Somehow rising to his feet, Leon moves his head toward th still hovering Maya, and the Driver lets him close the distance to her. Her face is almost frozen now, but Leon continues to move closer. Now he is face to face with her, and he moves his bloody lips to kiss her. She remains fixed like a statue as he begins a blood kiss, pressing his lips hard on hers. Suddenly Maya seems to come alive, with blood from Leon's mouth running. Maya's body arches back, her chest cavity opening up further, almost like wings. She gives Leon a skeletal embrace which he receives in winder, his eyes becoming fixed, cold, icy. INT. MAHOGANY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM -- DAY 115 A shrill metallic screech. Bad plumbing. A hand turns a faucet off, old water pipes, a moldy bathroom. The hand reaches up to straighten a tie. A modest brown suit. Clean. We see shoulders. It’s fit perfectly. A suit identical to the neatly-pressed one worn by Mahogany. Now we see cuff links, neat like Mahogany’s cuf links. And, on the wrist, a twisted silver bracelet with moon. INT.

As he leans over it, we recognize the BLACK VALISE. He takes out several corkscrew tools and inspects them. THE LID OF THE VALISE SLOWLY CLOSES ON ITS OWN. Leon steps up to the hallway door, he picks up a BLACK LEATHER BAG from the floor. We hear a quiet metallic clatter. Engraved on the leather is the name “Mahogany.” Leon pauses and cocks his head. Hodge now stands right behind Leon, and she takes a leath datebook out of her coat and presents it to him. It is th same datebook which Hodge took from Maya. Leon holds the book a minute, glances at its contents, th stuffs it inside his coat. He opens the outer door. A uniformed cop has his back to us in the doorway, but he moves to let Leon pass.
