SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns him into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbi his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitou path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entail going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominousl pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping  over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching th chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off th alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We ge the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every wa morning of his life. Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, grop with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them,  however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back towa the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he i sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out an shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears.

Her shoes neatly line the floor and the s above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an  orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance. Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls on out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too smal for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to pu it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in betw two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends dow and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumple under them on the floor.
