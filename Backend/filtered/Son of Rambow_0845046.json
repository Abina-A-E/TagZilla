In the near darkness we see a group of ten BURMESE SOLDIERS lead out a terrified cluster of FIVE YOUNG KAREN MEN and roughly shove them to the berm of the paddy. What is even more disturbing is several of the troopers are no more than 13 to 15 years old. As the young KAREN prisoners stand knee-deep in the murky water, the soldiers OVERTLY place bets among themselves...a dead-eyed Burmese MAJOR in his thirties named PA TEE TINT, motions to LT. AYE, who gestures to TWO SOLDIERS holding FLARE GUNS. The weapons explode and the darkness suddenly illuminates into a glowing CRIMSON RED. The YOUNG KAREN men, who are situated in a line, like RUNNERS at a track meet, are ordered to run for their lives. They’re frozen in fear as the boisterous soldiers fire shots at their feet. They’re still reluctant until LT. AYE motions to the SOLDIER at his side and without hesitation the obedient trooper raises his rifle and fires POINT BLANK into the nearest prisoner’s back. The hapless soul crumbles face first into the dark water. The terror-stricken men commence running and the soldiers cheer for their preferred bets, like one would do for a favorite racing dog. As the MEN near the opposite bank, the KAREN PRISONER in the CENTER steps on a submerged LAND MINE, bursting the muddy water upward like a bloody geyser and sends the man’s broken body into the air finally crumbling like a broken doll in to the marshland below. The vocal soldiers pay off one another as the dead-eyed MAJOR TINT looks on without emotion.",

The SOLDIERS fire shots and one KAREN PRISONER weakly musters the strength to defiantly face the infuriated soldiers. He drops to the muddy ground and begins to pray. Without removing his eyes from the intended target, RAMBO places the arrow on the taunt bow string and slowly draws it back. The incensed SOLDIER jams the muzzle of his rifle against the prisoner’s head and prepares to pull the trigger Suddenly a HISSING SOUND is heard and a black ARROW penetrates the soldier's back and protrudes from his chest. The SECOND SOLDIER is attempting to un-shoulder his rifle when another arrow fatally buries itself through his body. The THIRD soldier is almost killed simultaneously. The FOURTH SOLDIER tries to get to his rifle, but can’t and runs. RAMBO buries an arrow in his back. The soldier staggers forward and steps into the rice paddy. With his last dying breath he turns and curses RAMBO, who lets another arrow go, which sinks into the defiant soldier’s chest. He falls forward and collapses on a LAND MINE. His \f88 shattered body is blown upwards then crashes to the mud@y earth. The stunned MERCENARIES rise from their cover. LEWIS (CONT’D) (re: Rambo) What the fuck was that?
