As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a familiar pose.  It is the same image of the \"Hero from the Sky\" that we saw earlier in the film.  The strange \"jagged edged longsword\" is Ash's chainsaw. The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the title \"EVIL DEAD\" appears on the screen acompanied by the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.
