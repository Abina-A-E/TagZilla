They fold into each other creating the first amino acids. The chains growing longer and more complex, a helix appears, a double helix, the birth of DNA. And we pull back revealing a nucleus inside of a single celled PROTOZOAN, now swinming with other protozoa, hundreds of them, no maybe thousands, tens of thousands. \f75.
