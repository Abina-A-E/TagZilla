Searching.  A sound.  FIRES.  No Simon.  More PIPES BURST.  It's ten or twenty degrees below zero in there already.  Everything is coated with supercooled ice. Footing becomes treacherous. Phoenix crawls through a jungle of pipe.  Gets a bead on Spartan's lower body.  Starts to strafe the area.  Dh uh. Everything has become so slick, the recoil drives him bac across the ice into the open.  Spartan sees him, FIRES. The recoil slams him back against a wall.

Spartan is hoisted high in air, smashed again and again against a pillar.  Phoenix slams him through a web of pipes.  Holds him in the freezing blast.  Ice forms all over Spartan.  He struggles.  It cracks off, reforms. Struggles again.  It cracks off.  Reforms.  Struggles again.  He's weakening. Reaches up.  Grabs the pipe, wrests it over, directs the blast at Phoenix.  Holds it steady.  Phoenix is frozen in place.  Coats in ice.  We can see the madness in his eyes.  Everything else is still.  He roars, breaks free.  Retreats from the blast.  Disappears as -- Spartan wrenches the pipe over to the claw arm.  Holds it directly over one joint.  Then clobbers it with the pipe.  It SHATTERS.  He drops. LIGHTS are beginning to EXPLODE from the cold.  It's dropped 30 degrees below zero in there by now.  Spartan spots Phoenix on the far side of the room.  Hundred feet away. Half a moment to catch his breath in the freezing cold, leans on exposed cryopuck.  It slides effortlessly. Spartan hurls it across the floor at Phoenix.  A five hundred pound hockey puck.  Phoenix barely avoids the crushing blow.  It rebounds back off the steel... No point fighting the elements.  Spartan hurls himself across the floor.  Spins slowly twice along the way. It's like zero grav in two dimensions.  No friction coefficient at all. Three quarters of a second across the floor.  Right hook into Phoenix's surprised face. Phoenix goes flying a hundred feet back into the far side.  Crashes and falls. The CRYO PRISON CREAKS and SCREAMS in protest from the cold.  LIGHTING, grids, struts SHATTER, fall about them. They hurl themselves together again.  Spartan lands a horrific blow.  All but drives Phoenix's nose and eye sockets through the back of his head.  Spartan's forearm is terribly cut. The blood freezes solid as it sprays, sealing the wound, and leaving a giant six foot red feather spray.  Spartan brushes it away, breaks off, bleeds, freezes again instantly. They fly apart again.  Spartan comes to a stop near a tool cart.  Pokes at the tools.  One is an MTL cutting laser.  He has no idea what it is.  Nothing there he recognizes.  Picks up a four foot wrench.  That, he recognizes.  He looks like a caveman.  A very angry caveman. The building complains loudly.  Falling apart around them.  More and more PIPES EXPLODE, BURST, it gets colder and colder.  50 degrees below by now. Phoenix, on the far side, also scrambles for a weapon. He sees an MTL as well, but he knows what it is. FIRES it up.  Focused three inch cutting beam comes out.  Rips off the top cover, pulls out five optical elements, pulls out the choke tube, rips the whole front off the MTL.  Doesn't look very sleek now. FIRES it. A thirty foot long spray of white white magnesium- thermite flame comes flying out. One swipe, he clears the ice from a path he can walk towards Spartan on. Metal bars melt away as the thermite flare crosses through them. On the top level of the cryo prison, the first batch of raving psychopath defrosted cryocons wanders in to watch John Spartan die. This is the most depraved, frightening-looking group of individuals you've ever seen in your life.",

The difference between the 2000 degrees plus and 80 degrees below is more than any metal can handle.  Fissures appear in giant lightning strike cracks in all directions where the MTL hits. Every bit of ice in the building melts.  Water boiling away instantaneously in the path of the MTL. Spartan has nowhere to run.  And nothing but a big fucking club.  To his left he suddenly sees an empty chamber.  Except this one was never filled.  The display reads:  READY FOR CRYO. There's a tiny white chip in the vial inside the vacuum bell.  Spartan looks at it.  It's like a very bad memory coming back.  But he knows what it is and knows what it does.  Smashes the vacuum bell with the wrench. Simon grows closer. Spartan bashes the robot arm out of the way.  Picks up the vial.  Looks around desperately.  No point using it if it's going to kill him too.  Grabs the grid of the floor above him.  Heaves himself up. Simon lifts the MTL towards him.  It almost reaches up to the landing above.  Spartan hurls the VIAL at Simon's feet. It SHATTERS.  Nothing happens.  The heat from the MTL has boiled off all the water in a ten foot circle nearby. The MTL flame comes closer.  In a moment Spartan will get cooked.  Instead of running away, he moves closer. Stands up on the railing of the second landing.  And just as his clothes begin to catch fire from the heat, leaps -- Over the oncoming thermal flame as it arcs up towards him.  And over and past Phoenix. Spartan lands behind him, coming around with an elbow into Phoenix's kidney, causing Phoenix to drop the MTL. Outside their circle of heat, the tiny chip hits the water.  Melts.  And again, like the opposite of watching ice shatter, the water everywhere goes steel solid, stuttering out in all directions. Phoenix still has a free hand.  Smashes a nerve center on the side of Spartan's neck.  Spartan twitches visibly from it.  Grunts. Spartan punches him right, left, right in the sternum. Phoenix coughs blood, spits it away. Steps back to launch a mighty blow at Spartan and -- His heel just steps into a puddle of water.  The tiniest rivulet drifts over, connects it to the main ice solid locked water. Simon feels his foot stuck.  And as he looks down in consternation, realizes in shock what's happened and then looks up, Spartan hits him straight from the shoulder with everything he has left, dead in the face, as Phoenix solidifies. Phoenix's head snaps clean off. Hits, like a ball bearing on polished steel.  Bounces with a CLANG.  Rolls off.  CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG. Spartan reaches desperately for the still spewing MTL as the rivulets close in towards him. Grabs onto it just in time.  Spins, melts off a protective circle around him. Looks up at the peanut gallery of cryocons.",
