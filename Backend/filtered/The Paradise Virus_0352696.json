The CDC levied fines against Synergy and three other primate companies and banned the shipment of monkeys into the United States for 18 months. 3.  No virus was found at the JFK animal unit where the monkeys entered the U.S.  The Philippine exporter would not allow a CDC/Army Team to inspect their animal quarantine unit. 4.  Monkeys with the Ebola virus were reported in primate quarantine units in Texas and Pennsylvania during the Reston outbreak. 5.  Nancy and Gerry Jaxx are both acting Colonels of Veterinary Medicine at USAMRIID and are actively involved in vaccine and viral research... including Ebola. 6.  Peter Jahrling is alive and well and Head of Virology at USAMRIID.  He continues his research on synthetic antibodies and is currently in South America isolating a new virus. 7.  C.J. Peters is now head of Special Pathogens at CDC i Atlanta.  He is currently in command of the CDC's efforts to control the spread of the Hantavirus outbreak in this country. 8.  Karl Johnson lives in Montana with his wife Merle nea the Gallatin River.  Karl isolated the Ebola virus in 1976, and the Hantavirus the same year.  If he isn't fishing, then Karl is currently consulting with C.J. Peters and the CDC on the Hantavirus outbreak in the U.S. that is still talking human lives as of this writing.",
