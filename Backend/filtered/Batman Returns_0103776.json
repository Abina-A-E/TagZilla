The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But th FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out o way.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off h head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blo from the second guy's tire iron. In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHA belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops th tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he to his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISH the iron -- -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH KICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGUR nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can the ground. The FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with astonishment.

Faced with renew resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAI race off to their VAN. Triumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied t everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward trees. But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the K runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down him... CLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE.  The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing ther with a baseball bat. He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to feet -- thanks for returning the favor.
