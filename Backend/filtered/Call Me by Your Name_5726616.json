How you live your life is your business. Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there’s sorrow. Pain. Don’t kill it and with it the joy you’ve felt. PERLMAN takes a breath. PERLMAN (CONT’D) We may never speak about this again. But I hope you’ll never hold it against me that we did.
