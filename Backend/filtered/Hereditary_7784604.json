It’s exact same style as Joan’s. Embroidered into it is the na “ANNIE”. Under that is another mat, bearing the name “CHARLES” and featuring the now-familiar sigil of PAIMON. Annie goes to the next box. She dig through a collection herbs and oils, and beneath those, she finds a familiar hardback: NOTES ON SPIRITUALISM. Below this, a couple oth hardbacks: one that appears to be a GRIMOIRE (book of spe and the other titled INVOCATIONS. \fGreen Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 99. INVOCATIONS’ cover features an esoteric sigil. Annie open the book to find that it’s filled with vivid etchings of DEMONIC POSSESSION RITUALS. Annie goes to a MARKED PAGE. It features an illustration beastly man with a hulking body and a strangely effeminat face. He rides a dromedary and wears a crown. Tied to his is a collection of SEVERED HEADS. Behind him is a queue o frolicking ghouls, all headless and all playing instrumen A title reads “King Paimon (God of Mischief).\" Annie finds a HIGHLIGHTED PARAGRAPH: \"When successfully invoked, Paimon will possess the most vulnerable host. On when the ritual is complete will Paimon be locked into hi ordained host. Once locked in, a new ritual is required t unlock the possession.\" A sentence underlined in pencil reads: \"Paimon is Male, t covetous of a male human body.\" The next page features an etching of a man sitting atopa mountain of treasure. A caption reads: “The riches to the conjurer.\" Annie comes to the TITLE PAGE of the book. There isa handwritten NOTE. It reads: My darling, dear, beautiful Annie, Forgive me all the things I could not tell you, as TI truly could not. Please don’t hate me and try not to despair your losses. You will see in the end that they were worth it. Our sacrifice will pale next to the rewards. Love, Mommy Mortified, Annie throws the book into the box, and digs deeper to find TWO PHOTO ALBUMS, familiarly titled “Memories.” Annie flips through one of the albums. For a while, nothi of note. But then she FINDS something... A PHOTO of ANNIE’S MOTHER, 20 years younger, standing wit JOAN, also 20 years younger. They both wear replicas of Annie's NECKLACE - the one bearing the now-familiar sigil Paimon. Stunned, Annie continues through the photo album. She fin SEVERAL MORE PHOTOS FEATURING JOAN, who's often standing the background. Always wearing the necklace. She and Anni Mother were evidently close friends. Another photo: Annie’s mother guides a baby bottle into B CHARLIE’s mouth. The bottle’s milk is polluted with black herbs. \f133 134 135 100. Finally, Annie comes to a particularly bizarre photo.
