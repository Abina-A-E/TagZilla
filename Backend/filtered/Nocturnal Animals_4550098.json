Dead silence as the moveme gradually speeds up to real time. We slowly pull back to reveal that our image is that of a giant nude woman dress in nothing but tiny bits of glitter, white vinyl boots an small tulle cape. She is gyrating madly and flinging her around in some sort of windstorm. As we pull back further come to understand that what we are looking at is an art installation: a floor to ceiling LCD screen. The sound of breathing. A close up of a woman’s eyes now fills our screen. SUSAN MORROW, 42, handsome. Sleek. Ther a very slight hint of panic on her face as she stares acr the crowded, brightly lit room. Abruptly our sound snaps on at a deafening decibel level we hear what seems like a thousand voices screaming over other. The screens cover the four walls of the gallery and the effect of wall to wall, floor to ceiling breast and ass jiggling is oddly impressive. The obese women on the LCD screens are nude but dressed in bits and pieces of Americ one is playing the part of a cheerleader with red tinsel poms, one a majorette twirling a baton while another wear beauty queen’s ribbon and waves small American flags. The taunt us and tease us. On raised plinths scattered around the room are incredibl life like sculptures of seemingly the same corpulent wome our video screens. These women appear to be dead and are lying face down. Nude except for jewelry, shoes and small bits of tinsel wrapped around their ankles and waists. The room is jammed with people laughing and talking. The crowd is a collection of what passes in contemporary Los Angeles culture as the chic and fashionable. Photographer track several of the guests as the flash of their cameras heightens the excitement in the room.",
