From this high up we can see how isolated the school is - surrounded on one side by thick forest. A small campus, mostly brick and ivy. In the Quad, a fraction of the students amble to their classes. We glimpse the highlights: THE FOOTBALL FIELD. SORORITY ROW. AN ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE DORMS. INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING A boxed shrine to hip. From the “BLADE RUNNER” and vintage “STAR WARS” posters to the book shelf lined with plastic-sealed comics. Tangled in black skull and crossbone sheets, we find TERESA “Tree” GELBMAN, 19, beautiful. Outside, the bell tolls one final time before a calm settles over the room. The quiet doesn’t last long as Tree’s CELL PHONE plays “Happy Birthday”. Tree stirs through the fog of her hang-over, searching for her phone. As she sits up, several things hit her at once: she’s not in her room, she's wearing a guy's T- shirt, and the guy it probably belongs to is bent down, putting something away under the couch. CARTER DAVIS, 19, good looks hidden behind grunge and stubble, turns around and smiles at Tree.",
