Overcome by a blinding rage, he leans Emily’s lifeless bo against the wall. Sits her upright, against the badly damaged plaster wall. He tenderly brushes her hair from her pretty face as the achingly cold water continues to spray from the fire sprinklers above. Despite the extensive damage suffered by the vestibule, t emergency lights continue to strobe, interspersing flashe white light with moments of almost complete darkness...

Pours a small amount of the tequila onto the jacket liner Stuffs it into the bottle, letting a portion hang outside serve as a wick. A Molotov Cocktail. David then exits what’s left of the vestibule. Walks past the crashed security car. Sees that the gas peddle is wed to the floor with the tire iron. He approaches Corey’s drenched, dead body. He grabs hold of the screwdriver in Corey’s stomach, look away -- and YANKS it out.

She leans against the plaster wall, where he left her. \f96. Tragically beautiful. This galvanizing image brings David to his breaking point The temperature is crippling.

It lights on the first try. He touches the flame to the alcohol-soaked jac liner. It catches.

The strobe light continues to flash, outside and inside t vestibule... The green security lights spin atop the security car as s emanates from under its damaged hood... The night’s madness has reached its crescendo.. David moves in closer, the screwdriver outstretched befor him. Every step he takes gathers more purpose.
