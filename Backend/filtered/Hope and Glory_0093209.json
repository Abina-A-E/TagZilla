Heads move back and forth above the fences that divi the narrow strips of land, moving to the sound of unseen lawn mowers. In one of these gardens two children, BILL (aged eight) a his sister SUE (aged six) disport themselves. They are sprawled out on the lawn, heads and hands intent on something hidden from view in the lush vegetation of a rockery garden. Beneath those flowers and plants is a dar and mysterious forest, shaded by huge leaves, and broken by towering boulders. Mounted figures of medieval knights ride in, guided by BILL'S gigantic hand. A wizard appears in the path of the riders who draw up sharply. BILL gives an impression of neighing horses. SUE'S face looms up between large leaves. She makes the sound of spooky wind.",
