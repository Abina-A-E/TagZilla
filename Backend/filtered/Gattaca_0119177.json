JEROME approaches another man slumped over one of the ben EUGENE.  He clutches an empty vodka bottle.  He is snorin lightly - sleeping off the night before.  As JEROME gentl prises the bottle out of his hand, we are struck by the similarity of Eugene's face to Jerome's. Jerome pulls Eugene's chair back from the desk with surpr ease.

After covering Eugene with a blanket, Jerome enters a bat containing a surgically-clean stainless steel basin, sink shower and toilet.

It is still early as JEROME exits the building's undergro parking garage in an immaculate Studebaker Avanti and pro down the long straight driveway.  He exchanges a wave wit GARDENER trimming a lawn.

They filter through a row of channels supervised by SECUR GUARDS.  Each channel contains a computerized security de featuring a slim groove in which the employee places a fi under the watchful eye of a Security Guard. Jerome gives a polite nod to a Guard as he places his ind finger in the groove.  His fingertip is jabbed with the finest of needles and a minute blood sample taken.
