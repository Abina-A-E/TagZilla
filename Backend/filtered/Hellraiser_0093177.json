There are chains - dozens of them - disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated, others simply drip blood. The bell tolls on. On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function. It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains an enigma. A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles, reaches down and picks the box up. In close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers.  It is open at present, its polished innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box.",

The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing into the gloom. We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest of moments.  Then they're gone. The box is almost returned to its unopened condition. The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box, and the bell. It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place. The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune stops. At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is dust settling through the air. Otherwise it is empty. The bell fades. It's as if nothing ever happened here. Except ... Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp of a thing barely alive.",

She races for the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her. She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now. Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more. She raises the box to retaliate.

STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY.    The box falls from KIRSTY's hand.  The beast moves to bite at STEVE, who scrambles out of the way, leaving KIRSTY in the front line. The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER, which now uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her, its legs still bracing it in the door. She snatches for the box.  THE ENGINEER, its mouth oozing fluids, almost catches her arm. Again, she tries.   This time one of its arms seizes hold of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws. Behind KIRSTY, STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and flings it in THE ENGINEER's face.  It momentarily relaxes its grip on KIRSTY, who slides her hand from its hold and claims the box.  She now has slime on her finger The box defies her manipulations.",
