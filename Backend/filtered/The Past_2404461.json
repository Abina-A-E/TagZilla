So I called Samir without her seeing me to and asked him to come quickly. When he came and heard the story, he got very angry with his wife and said sorry to the customer and said he’d pay for the dress. He asked her to call the police and tell them that the issue was resolved. The customer said she'd do it only if his wife apologized to her. And then Celine started screaming and yelling at me saying I had no right to call Samir behind her back. I didn’t say anything. I just took my purse to leave, but Samir came and took my hand, like this... He said I had to stay. Instead, he asked his wife to leave. In front of the customer, in front of me, he threw her out.. and I stayed. Now all three are quiet. Upset, Ahmad looks at the stain the dress and Lucie stares at Naima who is upset.",
