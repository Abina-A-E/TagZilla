Ahead, an SS CAPTAIN waits beside a pit which is being du a large group of prisoners -- themselves uniformed GERMAN SOLDIERS, possibly deserters, stripped of helmets and equipment -- who are working at the gunpoint of a third S GUARD. Some are working with spades, others are forced to scratc the earth with bare hands -- trying not to look at the approaching soldiers, as if to deny their existence.
