It was in someone’s living room with all the lights on and like nothing I'd ever seen before. A strange, surreal dystopian story. So well acted and one of the actors was this big shaggy bear who played all his lines looking directly at me which I knew couldn't be really the case, but it felt that way, and of course later I learned that it was.

We spent the whole night and next day together, and I just... never left. And to be honest, all the problems were there in the beginning, too.

I realized that I didn’t really ever come alive for myself, I was just feeding his aliveness. He was so smart and creative, it didn’t matter. I would tell him things at home, in private, and then they would work their way into public conversation, into his work and for a while that felt like enough. I was just so flattered that someone like him would find an idea of mine worth using or a comment of mine worth repeating. And then I got pregnant. And I thought “having a baby will be ours, really ours, and it will also really be mine” and he was so excited. And it was nice for a while. But kids... they belong to themselves. Like the instant they leave your body, it’s just a process of going away from you. And I didn’t belong to myself. It was stupid stuff and big stuff-- All of the furniture in our house was his taste. I wasn’t even sure what my taste was anymore because I'd never been asked to use it. I didn’t even pick our apartment, I just moved into his. I made noises about wanting to move back to LA, but it came to nothing. We’d come here on holidays because he liked my family, but whenever I suggested we do a year or something, he’d put me off. It would be so weird if he had turned to me and said “And what do you want to do today?” I watched that long documentary about George Harrison and I thought “just own it, own it like George Harrison's wife.
