Behind her Leo quickens his pace. I She peers into the faces of passers-by, seeking some unpreoccupied person who might be sympathetic and helpful People pass her, intent on their own business and without concern. She begins to run. Leo merely lengthens his stri It is easy for him to keep up with her. A few people turn their heads to watch her run, but Leo's long strides attr no attention. Suddenly, in desperation, she dashes across street. A cab narrowly misses hitting her and a bus, comi from the other direction, has to stop with an appalling scream and roar of brakes. Jacqueline, shaken, out of breath and trembling, reaches other corner of the- street. She pauses for a moment to t a deep breath. She looks back of' her. There is no sign o Leo. Again she starts on and from the shadow of a light standard a deeper shadow detaches itself and steps out be her. It is Leo and he is grinning. She sees him and begin run down the cross street. She runs wildly. Leo, at first lengthens his stride, and then suddenly breaks into a lop a lope that will bring him up to her within an instant. She ducks into an alley and is lost in the darkness. She hides in a corner amid some debris, crouching back out of light. Leo plunges ahead in pursuit. Jacqueline stands a moment as the sound of his footsteps diminish, then turns back and begins running down the street. Ahead of her, a slim figure, not unlike Leo's, is walking up the street toward her. She dodges into the next alley. This is an alley behind a theatre. It is cluttered with all sorts of strange impedimenta; flats, crates, etc. There is an overhead lam burning in the center of the alley, but the periphery of light beneath it, does not extend to the walls of the all The area immediately adjacent to these walls is heavy wit darkness and strange shadows. Jacqueline stands in the mi of the pool of light and listens. It seems to her that sh can hear in the darkness the soft tap-tap of someone walk on his toes. She shrinks back from the bright light into darkness and begins to grope her way along the wall, She going from left to right. A sound at her right attracts h attention and she looks off, but continues to grope her w along the wall to the left. Her hand passes from the roughness of the wall to the smoothness of cloth and a sp second later, Leo, whom she has touched, grins as he seiz her wrist. She screams and then silently struggles to fre herself. Still smiling he holds her firmly with his right band. With his left hand he draws something from his pock He presses a button on this and a four-and a-half inch kn blade flashes out. Jacqueline stands stock still with fri Leo's hand goes back for the blow. At the opposite side of the alley a door is suddenly thro wide open and a great patch of light is thrown on Jacquel and Leo. He puts the knife behind his back. Out of the door come half a dozen people in costumes. The are members of a ballet company performing in the theatre Also there emerges the sound of loud and merry music. The actors are in a gay mood laughing and shouting. One o them breaks into a half dance step. It is infectious and rest join in, making a sort of Carmagnole that sweeps dow the alley. Jacqueline breaks from Leo's hand-hold on her wrist and runs in among them. One of the dancers is an enormous man dressed in Roman ha armor to represent the god Gambrinus, with gilded hop blo as a garland about his shoulders and wearing a papier mac mask, surmounted by crown of similarly gilded hop leaves wheat.
