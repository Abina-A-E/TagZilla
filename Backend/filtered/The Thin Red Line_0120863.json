With his left hand he te a grenade from his belt, stops firing the pistol long eno to pull the pin with one finger, and lobs the grenade ove into the camouflaged roof of the emplacement, which he ca now see clearly since it is only about twenty yards away, where the grenade EXPLODES uselessly and without effect.
