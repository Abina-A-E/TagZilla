What matters is that you don't  regret who you were, who you are- What if Steven Spielberg had quit  the audio/visual club because it  wasn't \"cool\"? What if Rosie  O'Donnell had stopped cracking  jokes because someone told her  they were stupid?  What if Michael  Jordan never went back to basketball  after he got cut from his high  school team?. (a beat) In this room right now, there could  be a future Nobel Prize winner, a  Supreme Court Justice, an amazing  Mom. Find out who you are and don't  be afraid of it.
