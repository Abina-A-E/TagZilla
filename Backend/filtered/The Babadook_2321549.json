Amelia flicks her arm out and turns it off. \f77 64. INT. AMELIA’S BEDROOM - LATER 77 Amelia lies wide awake in bed on her side. Samuel is out to it. She turns over, restless, staring at the ceiling. That sound downstairs again. Only this time, it comes up the stairs and stops outside her door. Amelia freezes. A slight scratching sound at the door. She starts to panic, the scratching gets louder. She hears a whimpering. It’s the dog. She springs out of bed and opens the door, relieved. Bugsy runs in, jumps straight up on the bed, finds a spot near Samuel and settles. Amelia jumps under the covers. Silence. Darkness. Amelia’s eyes flicking, nervous. The scratching starts up again, only this time it can’t be the dog. Amelia stares at the door unable to move. The door clicks and moves open by itself. Amelia watches, her heart in her throat. The rustling, scratching sound moves inside the room. Amelia slips the covers over her head, terrified. She can’t see anything now. The sound appears to be moving closer. After an age, Amelia pulls down the duvet, unable to stand it anymore. She peers into the terrible darkness. Something large and black lurks in one corner on the ceiling. She can’t make out what it is. Time stops. The shadow scuttles quickly across the ceiling. It stops right above her head. Amelia is paralyzed by fear. She hears a rasping sound. The thing appears to be breathing. Her hand reaches for the bedside lamp. Her eyes are fixed on the dreaded shadow right above her head. Before she can get there, the thing drops down right on top of her. She sees its hideous, mask like face millimetres from her own; the black eyes, the mouth wrenched open in a permanent, silent scream. She takes a huge breath, as if breathing the thing in, terrorized. Amelia switches on the lamp, springs out of bed and turns on the overhead light. Bugsy barks. Samuel wakes. There’s nothing there. Samuel sits up, trying to focus. \f78 65.",

All the lights still on. The TV is up loud. Amelia tries desperately to stay awake, absently hitting the remote. Commercials, nature program, soap opera. An old black and white George Méliés clip appears on the screen. Beautiful silent images, childlike but slightly disturbing. Just like the Babadook book. A weird tinkling lullaby accompanies them, seducing her to sleep. She fights it, her head nodding forward and back, a drowsy agitation, desperate to stay awake. The Méliés images stream in front of her. People dismembered, heads growing larger and smaller, old style cinema tricks. Strange and sinister. Emotions pass over Amelia’s face as she watches, agitation, amusement, exhaustion, fear. Something is brewing. She jerks forward and back, her eyes heavy. Her face speeds up. It looks bizarre. The tinkly piano music continues to play. And still she doesn’t sleep. Amelia's face returns to normal speed, she looks around. The sun is coming through the windows. It’s already morning. She leans over. Something doesn’t feel right. She looks to Samuel asleep on the couch, his back to her. Bugsy peers over Samuel, studying Amelia with caution. She returns the dog’s stare, unblinking. There’s an eery silence in the room. She looks at the TV. It’s on mute. Amelia suddenly lurches forward and manages to stand. She centres herself momentarily, then shuffles to the stairs. \f66. INT.

She's frightened, but does her best to conceal it. The rumbling increases. She can see a familiar shadow in the corner, moving ever so slightly. A low insect like noise. She braces herself, peering in to try and see it. A sound behind her. The back of Amelia’s head as she turns around, her eyes widening. \f120 98.

The sounds around her are horrible, threatening. Amelia seen from above. She is bent right back as she forces her head to look up. She lets out a low guttural warning sound, then a shout, full of power.. Her back releases slightly, she is able to right herself, standing eye to eye with something we don’t see.
