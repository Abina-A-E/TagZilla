Sitting four rows back and on the other si of the aisle, JESSE, also mid-twenties, is engrossed in K Kinski’s memoir, All I Need Is Love. Casually good lookin but a little scruffy, he dresses in the jeans and T-shirt mode.

The HARPSICHORD PLAYER’s entire room is decorated in a seventeenth-to eightenth-century fashion with wood-plank floors, old furniture, and paintings. Together with the beautiful and intense music, it is a stunning view - a li portrait. They sort of look at each other occasionally bu say nothing. Celine and Jesse both begin to feel awkward their Peeping Tom status now that the music is over, and walk off quietly. Jesse takes her hand.",
