And I turned in my S.D.S.  card and my crash helmet and followed  him. It was a disaster, at least for  me. My father had received the  revelation, not I. He stood gaunt on  a mountain slope and preached the  apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians.  I masturbated a great deal. We lived  in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit  and crushed piГ±on nuts. It was  hideous. Within two months, I was  back in Boston, a hollow shell and  dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with  everything. I turned to austerity,  combed my hair tight and entered  nursing school. I became haggard,  driven and had shamelessly incestuous  dreams about my father. I took up  with some of the senior staff at the  hospital. One of them, a portly  psychiatrist, explained I was  generated by an unresolved lust for  my father. I apparently cracked up.  One day, they found me walking to  work naked and screaming obscenities.  There was talk of institutionalizing  me, so I packed a bag and went back  to my father in the Sierra Madre  Mountains.

I threw  him out of the house last year.  Pietistic little humbug. He preached  universal love and despised everyone.  He had a blanket contempt for the  middle class, even its decencies. He  detested my mother because she had  petit bourgeois pride in her son the  doctor. I cannot tell you how  brutishly he ignored that rather  good old lady. When she died, he  didn't even come to the funeral. He  thought the chapel service an  hypocrisy. His generation didn't  live with lies, he told me. \"Everybody  lives with lies,\" I said. I grabbed  him by his poncho, dragged him the  full length of our seven-room  despicably affluent middle-class  apartment and flung him out. I haven't  seen him since. But do you know what  he said to me as he stood there on  that landing on the verge of tears.  He shrieked at me: \"You old fink!  You can't even get it up anymore!\"  That was it, you see. That was his  real revolution. It wasn't racism  and the oppressed poor and the war  in Vietnam. The ultimate American  societal sickness was a limp dingus.  Hah! (he lurches about,  laughing rustily) My God, if there is a despised and  misunderstood minority in this  country, it's us poor impotent  bastards. Well, I'm impotent and  proud of it!

Two hours ago,  walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty- Seventh Street and Second Avenue,  eight o'clock in the morning, broad  daylight, I got mugged. A sixteen- year-old girl walks up to me, shows  me a knife about a yard long and  says, \"Give me your wallet.\" I thought  she was kidding. I mean there's  hundreds of people walking right by.  Well, she wasn't kidding. \"Listen,\"  I said, \"all I got's about twenty  bucks.\" So she takes the wallet  anyway. So I said, \"How about leaving  me my identification?\" I mean, I had  my driver's license, my Diner's Club,  my credit cards. But she took them  all, the whole damn wallet, credit  cards, everything. So I stopped some  guy, I said, \"Hey, you see that girl  there, walking away?\" He says, \"Yeah.\"  I said, \"She just stole my wallet,  credit cards and everything.\" He  says, \"Well, that's what they want,  the credit cards.\" So I started  looking for a cop. I mean, go find a  cop, right? Well, I finally find a  cop. The girl's halfway to South  America by now, probably bought the  ticket with my credit cards. So the  cop says, \"What's your name?\" And  you want to know something? I couldn't  think of my name. The girl took all  my identification, you know what I  mean? She took all my credit cards.  So I said, \"You know this is screwy.  I can't think of my name.\" So he  took me to the station house. The  sergeant says, \"What's your name?\" I  said, \"I don't know! She took all my  credit cards!\" So they took me down  here. So what do you think, Doctor?  I'm nuts, right? I finally flipped.",
