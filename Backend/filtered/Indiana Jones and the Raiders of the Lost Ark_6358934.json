His right hand slides up under the ba of his leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of a neatly curled bullwhip.  With the same fluid move that brings Indy's body around to face the Peruvian, the whip uncoils to its full ten foot length and flashes out. The fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of the lash) wraps itself around Barranca's hand and pistol. He could not drop the gun now if he tried. Indy gives the whip a short pull and Barranca's arm in jerked down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the dirt.  Barranca is amazed, but feels some slack in the whip and immediately raises the gun toward Indy again, cocking it with his free hand. Indy's face goes hard.  And sad. Indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc.  Barranca spins around enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against his body.  Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle and Barranca's gun fires.  Barranca falls dead. Indy looks quickly at Satipo, who is shocked and fright- ened.  He raises his arms in supplication.",

A dead bird lies on one of the white tiles.  Its body is riddled with little deadly darts.  This has great signi- ficance to Indy and he stands with even greater caution. He waves the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current whips at the flame.  Indy ducks under it and leaves a burn mark on the white tile beneath it. Satipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified. Indy reaches the altar.  The tiny idol looks both fierce and beautiful.  It rests on a pedestal of polished stone. Indy looks the whole set-up over very carefully.  From his jacket he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad.  He begins filling it with dirt from around the case of the altar.  When he has created a weight that he thinks ap- proximates the weight of the idol, he bounces it a couple times in his palm concentrating.

Now he sets himself again.  And makes the switch!  The idol is now in his hand, the bag on the pedestal.  For a long moment it sits there, then the polished stone beneath the bag drops five inches.

The men do not touch the Ark itself; rather they carry it by use of two long wooden poles which pass through rings in the corners of the Ark.  The painting is very dramatic, full of smoke, tumult and sinewy dying men.  But the most astounding thing in the picture is the brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing from the wings of the angels.  It pierces deep into the ranks of the retreating enemy, wreaking devastation and terror.",

In the cab, Indy has been concentrating on the lead staff car.  Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in the side view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side.  A quick glance to the other mirror reveals the others.  As the truck sweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start to turn his steering wheel--he is going to sideswipe the walls of the tunnel At the other end of the tunnel, we hear the roar of the two engine and two long, screeching, scraping sounds.  Th lead staff car shoots out of the tunnel, then the truck, its sides cleaned of Nazis. In the rear of the truck, the Tough Sergeant is looking with distaste back at the tunnel.  There remains only him and two Armed Nazis with the Ark.  He sends these two cli ing up over the top of the truck. In the lead car, the Blond Driver is being pressed hard by Indy, who now edges up to bump them from the rear.  Su denly the Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Arm Nazis appear on the top of the truck.  Without thinking, he starts to point them out to Shliemann, then realizes his stupidity. In the cab, Indy has seen this and is at first mystified. He checks his sideview mirrors.  Then he figures it out and slams on his brakes.  The brakes lock, the wheels bur and the truck skids to a dusty halt.  The two Armed Nazis fly off the truck, over the cab to the road in front. Indy immediately hits the gas again.  The two Armed Nazis just aiming their weapons, get wiped out. In the rear of the truck, the crated Ark is bouncing all along, no one in sight, because-- The Tough Sergeant is on the top of the truck, making his way steadily forward.  This guy clearly knows what he's doing.  A submachine gun is slung across his back. The truck and the staff car race through a series of S-curves.  In the staff car, Belloq and Shliemann spot th Tough Sergeant as he reaches the front of the truck's top and begins to lower his submachine gun barrel toward the cab.  Indy is unaware.  Bellow and Shliemann exchange loo Then Shliemann yells to the Armed Guard in the front seat The Tough Sergeant has a line on Indy.  He points his gun The Armed Guard blasts away at the truck.  The Tough Ser- geant dies in a hail of bullets and flies off. Indy, who has ducked at the gunfire, is confused.  But wh he sees the Armed Guard up front lower his gun, Indy agai floors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest. The road is almost down to a level now.  In the distance- Cairo.  The road takes a little dogleg just before reach- ing level ground again.  Just as the staff car is about t make the turn, Indy smashes them from behind.  The staff car flies off the road and down a twenty foot embankment. Indy takes the truck speeding down the road and off towar Cairo. In the staff car, the occupants are bruised but safe. Shliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the Driver.  The staff car fishtails out of its sandy resting place and takes off after the truck.",
