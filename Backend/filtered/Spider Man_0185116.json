Begin OPENING CREDITS. THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and there. COBWEBS are all around. DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange featured man in his mid-fifties. His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the school administration and to \"procure\" whatever OCK needs for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS.",
