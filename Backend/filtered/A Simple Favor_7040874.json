For those of you new to my vlog ... (checking computer screen) That’s you, Babette9 and VioletsRblue, thanks for joining ... You should know that my best friend Emily is missing. She asked me for a simple favor: to pick up her son Nicky from school. That was nine days ago. She hasn’t come back yet ... (voice breaks; regroups) I hope you'll forgive me. I’m just so worried about her. And I want to help the police track her down. But I’m realizing I didn’t know her as well as I thought. Like my mother used to say, God rest her soul, “Secrets are like margarine. Easy to spread, but bad for the heart.” But as different as we were, I truly considered Emily my best friend. Our sons brought us together. She’s such a wonderful, elegant person ... She clears a tear, then composes herself. STEPHANIE (CONT’D I’m sorry, for all our new friends, let me catch you up.
