We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and sm apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-t street, sharply etched by the morning sun. Some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and w and wrought iron in the construction. The apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do  not. The neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for  people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and ca planning. The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat. It has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted  blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life wi earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learn to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignorin each other, except on direct invitation. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of a man fills the screen. It is so large that we do not see a features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek dow which a stream of sweat is running. THE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the wi and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall j outside the window. It registers 84. THE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open, and brings nearer to u room with a large studio window. We are able to see insid this room. A short, balding man is standing near the wind shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirro which he has set up on a shelf. To the right of him is a battered upright piano. On top o the piano is a radio. The music selection coming from the radio stops, and the announcer is heard.",

Contented, he returns to his shaving. THE CAMERA MOVES ON AND OVER to a far building. It passes over the face of this building until it comes to fire esc It goes up and near enough to one which has become the ou bedroom of a couple. We are near enough to see an alarm c hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously. A rises lazily to a sitting position. He gropes to switch t alarm off. We see that his pajamas are stained with sweat. In his si position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him. our surprise, the head of this other person -- a woman -- rises where his feet are. They have been sleeping in oppo directions. They sit limply looking at each other with  bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed  very little sleep in the heat of the night. THE CAMERA NOW MOVES DOWN toward the left onto another lo building. It MOVES IN A LITTLE to a living room window. J inside the windowsill, a small fan is oscillating. The fa sits on the right side of the table, and to the left of i is an automatic toaster. Behind the toaster stands a full-bodied young woman,  apparently wearing only a pair of black panties. Her stom navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. Just be her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulder and head. Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. She  takes them out, butters them. Then she turns around and b over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-ma She picks up the coffee-maker, and swings back to the tab to sit down. She does this so deftly that her breasts are never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. Th fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfi the exciting promise of her lack of clothes. THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a distant street corner seen betwe two buildings. The traffic is very light at this hour, bu Sanitation Department truck moves through the intersectio spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and kee the dust down. Three little kids in bathing suits run beh the truck, playing in the water. THE CAMERA MOVES OFF and around to some buildings at the  side. As it skims this building, we see a hand emerge fro one of the windows, and remove the cover from a birdcage  which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside. In the  cage are two lovebirds -- arguing. THE CAMERA NOW PULLS BACK SWIFTLY and retreats through th open window back into Jefferies' apartment. We now see mo of the sleeping man. THE CAMERA GOES IN far enough to sho head and shoulders of him. He is L. B. JEFFERIES. A tall, lean, energetic thirty fiv his face long and serious-looking at rest, is in other  circumstances capable of humor, passion, naive wonder and the kind of intensity that bespeaks inner convictions of  moral strength and basic honesty. He is sitting in an Everest and Jennings wheelchair. THE CAMERA PANS along his right leg. It is encased in a  plaster of Paris spica from his waistline to the base of toes. Along the white cast someone has written \"Here lie broken bones of L. B. Jefferies.\" THE CAMERA PANS to a nearby table on which rests a shatte and twisted Speed Graphic Camera, the kind used by fast-a news photographers. On the same table, the CAMERA PANS to an eight by ten glo photo print. It shows a dirt track auto racing speedway,  taken from a point dangerously near the center of the tra A racing car is skidding toward the camera, out of contro spewing a cloud of dust behind it. A rear wheel has come the car, and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly  into the camera lens. THE CAMERA MOVES UP to a framed photograph on the wall. It is a fourteen by ten print, an essay in violence, havi caught on film the exploding semi-second when a heavy  artillery shell arches into a front-line Korean battle  outpost. Men and equipment erupt into the air suspended i solution of blasted rock, dust and screeching shrapnel. T the photographer was not a casualty is evident, but surpr when the short distance between the camera and the explos is estimated. A signature in the lower right hand corner the picture reads -- \"L. B. Jefferies.\" THE CAMERA PANS to a second photograph of a picket line a an aircraft plant strike. Strikers, non-strikers and poli are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot. Clubs, fists and truncheons swing, blood flows, faces twi with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their  feet. The picture represents no distant, cautions photogr observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight  surrounds him and he had best defend himself. The same  signature, \"L. B. Jefferies,\" is in the corner. THE CAMERA PANS TO another framed picture, this one a  beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at  Frenchman's Flat, Nevada. It is the cul-de-sac of violenc The picture taken at a distant observation point, shows s spectators in the foreground watching the explosion throu binoculars. THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a shelf containing a number of cam photographic film, etc. It then PAN ACROSS a large viewer which is resting a negative of a woman's head. From this, THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a magazine cover, and  although we do not see the name of the magazine, we can s the head on the cover is the positive of the negative we  have just passed. THE CAMERA FINALLY COMES TO REST ON a pile of magazines - perhaps a hundred or so. They are all of the same publica",
