Skeletal heads looking back their shoulders -petrified backsides showing more stitche Several are as armless as the Venus DeMilo. Some missing other limbs. Heads. Feet. Genitals. Darry's growing repulsion moves him faster -how big is th room? Feels like a football field... Deeper along the hideous walls, Darry turns abruptly. Two withered corpses in the tapestry. On the finger of one: a large ring. An old Varsity ring. beam reflecting off its dusty jeweled surface. Darry star at it with unquestionable recognition. Looks slowly to the corpse beside it. A girl? Once? Her incision is all around her neck. As if her head had been severed and then sewn back on. EXT. OLD CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME. Trish parked at the corner of the old church. Keeping an on both directions of the empty two lane. Watching the lo shadows as the sun drops. Feels something creeping over her. Looks up. The sun is dropping behind the steeple of the church, the shadow of the tower slowly falling on her. She sits anxious in its growing darkness. INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME. The same below: Darry staring back at the distant archway the dying sunlight. Looks ahead at the cavern of the dead. The ambient light fading away over all those twisted faces... this place is getting really dark.",

In dank darkness, the music continues. Sounds like it's playing on a phonograph somewhere. Yes a phonograph. The kind with lots of analog hiss. We move toward the music, along an empty wall. At the end of which, in the long shadows, a tall figure i cape-like coat busies himself. Though we can’t tell with until we are up close. Sewing. Stitching. Fingers working nimbly with coarse bla thread. We see now the wall is not entirely empty. Several bodies mounted there. Not the ancient dead we have seen undergro at the church. These are fresher. Of much more recent demise. Sewn toget in the same grizzly fashion we know too well. And then KER-PLUNK! A new body is hung next to them. Hung a hook which we cannot see. Young Darry.
