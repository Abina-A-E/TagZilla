The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across. The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the  maelstrom. SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive  spire.  Smoothly curving and iridescent.  Off the starboa beam, a quarter mile away, another spire rises.  Tons of  seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the  energy of Niagara. Off the port bow... another spire. And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it. Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising. One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nea spire blocks out the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... vibrate with the THUNDER OF CREATION.

The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater stream off the back of the vast, slightly curved hull.  The miss cruiser rocks back and forth nearby, high and dry... its  prop whining futility.
