This is a power office -- bleak, modern and immense. It is on the 22nd floor with huge grid windows that look down on New York City. It's designed to impress and intimidate. There is futuristic design furniture, a wall of TV monitors, a private bathroom, a small kitchen, a bar. Above the ultra~modern desk hangs a Picasso from his 1907-8 “African-Negro\" period. The walls are decorated with primitive masks, the closest thing Frank has to a hobby.
