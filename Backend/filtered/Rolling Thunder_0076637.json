Maxwell and the chauffeur look at each other, shrug, and get back into the car. Once inside the INT. LIVING ROOM, Rane peeks through the front curtain to see 1f Maxwell has left yet. After a moment, the AF car drives away. Rane turns and walks directly through the living room. The room has been straightened and cleaned; there is a new carpet, but Rane doesn't even pause long enough to notice. Entering his CELLAR/WORKSHOP, Rane walks directly to his gun rack. He starts pulling guns out of the rack and placing them on a work table. - It is an impressive collection: 2 nickel-plated Coit Commander .45 automatics, a Smith and Wesson 357 Combat Magnum, a snub-nosed Colt Cobra .22 revolver, a Wincheste 12 gauge Super 6~shot pump shotgun, 2 Browning B-SS 12 gauge Double Barrel shotguns, plus clips and boxes and boxes of ammunition. With his good hand, Rane clamps the Winchester 6-shot into his workbench vice and proceeds to saw off the barrel. The barrel CLANGS to the cement floor. CU: lying on the floor, the sawed-off barrel looks like the leavings of a major amputation. Rane starts carrying his guns into the LIVING ROOM. TIMECUT: soon they are all spread on the sofa.

Rane removes a .45 and closes the trunk. Plac- ing the .45 under the front seat, he walks back toward the house. In the KITCHEN Rane rummages about for some food, but can only find a package of stale OREOs. He picks up the pack- age and a quart of J&B and walks back toward the living room. In the BEDROOM, he removes a stack of twenty dollar bills which had been hidden under the dresser, There appears to be about $500. When he slips the wad of bills into his pants pocket, Charlie feels something unusual there. Fishing around in his pocket, he comes out with a piece of paper. It reads: Linda Forchet TR6-3265 He looks at the paper a moment and walks back toward the living room. As he passes the bed, we notice the medals are no longer lying on it. By the time he gets in the LIVING ROOM, he has his mind made up. He sits down and dials the phone. He waits for the phone to ring. It does, and a girl's pleasant Texas VOICE comes on the other end.",

Linda, bouncing about in the back seat, SCREAMS. In the middle of this nightmare ride the car RADIO starts up with a hillbilly song.

Family photographs sit atop the piano, a framed poster of Yosemite Falls hangs above the worn green sofa, A color TV plays silently in the corner. The pea-green rug is worn through in two places beside the Woolworth coffee table. With the exception of Charlie, Johnny and Linda, every- one else in the room rates pretty low on the interest scale. The old man has one foot in the clouds, the other in the grave. The kids are bored shitless and the sister and brother-in-law chatter aimlessly. Johnny Vohden, about 26, .lean, handsome (we saw him in the credits), sits sandwiched on the sofa between his wife and sister. He once had soft babyish features, but they have grown prematurely hard and expressionless. He seems very uncomfortable, no longer the \"man\" Charlie had described. Johnny wears a Sixties tab-collar white shirt which seems a size too big for him. His hair is still cut short. He looks pathetically from side to side, Linda is wearing the new clothes Charlie bought for her and Rane wears his freshly pressed and cleaned AF uniform.
