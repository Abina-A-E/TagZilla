As the CAMERA leaves the INSERT of the newspaper and STARTS ITS RISE, we also catch a glimpse of official documents on which we SEE the words: \"TOP SECRET.\" MAN'S VOICE (reading) “--The photograph has been tentatively identified as that of Roger Thornhill, a Manhattan advertising executive, indicating that the name George Kaplan, which he gave to an attendant in the General Assembly Building, wes false. 4 possible mtive for the slaying was suggested by the discovery that earlier today, Thornhill appeared in a Glen Cove, Long Island police court on a charge of drumk driving with a stolen car, and in his defense charged that the murder victin, . M>. Townsend, had attempted to kill hin the night before... The man puts the newspaper down on the table, looks up at the other people. Their ages vary fron thirty-five to fifty; there is nothing about an Intelligence agent's appearance that cistinguishes him from, say, a college professor or a stock broker or a reporter or a housewife. These people . happen to be all of that, too. The gentleman who has been reading the newspaper, for example, is, among other things, a limer of comic cartoons for the national magazines.",
